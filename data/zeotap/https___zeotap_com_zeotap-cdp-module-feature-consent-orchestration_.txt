ZEOTAP CDP FEATURES
Consent Orchestration
Easily store and reflect customer consent and marketing preferences across the customer journey
Why choose Zeotap CDP
Built for EuropeMost CDPs are built for North America, where rules on data consent are more relaxed. From our German HQ, we've engineered our platform to meet the world's strictest consent environment.
Made for marketersMarketers are the ones most often dealing with the day-to-day of consent collection and activation—we design to make it easy for them to keep compliance in check.
Designed for activationStoring consent is only useful if marketers can easily activate it across campaigns. Our platform lets you easily reflect consent across every segment and channel.
Success stories and quotes
"Based on my experience, I can honestly say Zeotap’s platform is without equal. Brands can happily jettison a complex and
inefficient patchwork of point solutions in favour of their unified stack for all data-related activities."
Kay SchwabedalChief Digital Officer, Virgin Media O2
"Zeotap has always set the bar when it comes to quality and security. It is part of their DNA."
Steffen Roehnformer CIO, Deutsche Telekom
"Being the data centre for the entire EMEA region, we have found Zeotap to be the right partner to improve our customer data intelligence and the service we provide to our clients."
Jordi UrbeaChief Revenue Officer, Ogilvy
"Zeotap is a strategic partner of Google Cloud in EMEA, driving
additional value and improved experience for our customers with
GCP. We realise that leveraging first-party data to drive digital
transformation and omni-channel personalisation is top of mind for
retailers - while also ensuring the best-possible privacy and
security. We believe Zeotap - with its roots in Germany - is an
expert and reliable partner to help navigate the first-party data
opportunity."
Adaire Martin-FoxPresident of Google Cloud International and Head of Google Ireland
Get a single view of consent
No matter how or where you capture consent and marketing preferences, our customer data platform cuts through the chaos to standardise, master, and resolve them, so that you have a single record of consent as part of your single customer profile.
Guardrails for peace of mind
Marketers need to execute quickly – and don’t have time for a DPO to determine whether every new campaign has the right consent settings. Zeotap allows you to set universal rules for honouring consent, so you can launch campaigns safely knowing that you’ve got consent and marketing preferences covered.
From consent to preferences
In a world where transparency around data use is critical, you’re likely capturing more than just consent—you’re also storing a user’s preferences on how they want to be communicated to. Zeotap gives you the same orchestration ability with these preferences, helping you easily deliver the right communications.
