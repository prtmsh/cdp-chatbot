Client guarantees that each Affiliate will fully perform its obligations hereunder, and Client is responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Affiliates. 2.3 Only Users may access the System and use the Services for Client’s internal business purposes. Client shall ensure that the Users, employees and third parties it makes the Services available to as permitted herein are subject to confidentiality, security and privacy obligations substantially similar to the ones contained in this Agreement. Client is responsible and liable for (i) Client’s customers and Users’ access to the System and use of Services; and (ii) any use of the System and/or Services through Client and/or User account, whether authorised or unauthorised. 2.4 Client is responsible for selecting and configuring any Third-Party Platform integrated with the Services, for any other third-party products it chooses to use with the Services and for any transfer of Client Data it enables through the System. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Zeotap is not responsible for any Third-Party Platform or other third-party products used by Client with the Services, particularly how the providers use or protect Client Data. Client’s use of any Third-Party Platform or other products is subject to its separate agreement with the provider. The Parties acknowledge and agree that where a Third-Party Platform is utilised, the Parties shall use such platform in accordance with that Third Party Platform’s terms and conditions, policies and legal requirements. 3.
