USE CASE 1
Audience suppression
A unified customer database like Zeotap CDP lets marketers exclude customers from campaigns based on past purchases across all channels. This strategy increases conversion rates, boosts return on ad spend (ROAS), and prevents customers from receiving irrelevant or duplicate messages. Together with 360-degree customer views and automated audience segmentation, marketers can ensure customers receive only the most relevant messages. One Zeotap client saw a 38% higher click-through rate (CTR) and a 20% lower cost per order (CPO) across channels after suppressing audience segments.

USE CASE 2
Cross-sell and upsell campaigns
Marketers can track visitor behaviour and IDs in real-time from downstream activation platforms. They can apply rules to touch points across the customer journey to select the best product based on profile data, which is then sent to the advertising or marketing platform. By monitoring customer behaviour, marketers can adjust selections as needed. Meanwhile, predictive audiences provide even deeper customer insights. With cross-sell and upsell campaigns, marketers can now provide their customers with a more personalised experience to increase customer lifetime value and sales.

USE CASE 3
Abandoned cart campaigns
Marketers can leverage abandoned cart lists from advertising platforms to boost sales. By analysing profile data, they can determine the best approach for each customer, retargeting them with offers through email, mobile, social, web, and onsite channels. Customers are removed from the abandoned cart segment once they purchase, ensuring they no longer receive irrelevant offers and ads. This targeted strategy increases the chances of making a sale. One Zeotap client saw a 15% increase in conversion rates with personalised email reminders, and 42% of inactive users returned after receiving personalised offers.

How Virgin Media O2 accelerated acquisition and growth with Zeotap CDP
Virgin Media O2 aimed to reduce cost per order (CPO) and increase conversion rates in its digital advertising campaigns by refining its paid acquisition strategy. To achieve this, they used Zeotap CDP to exclude irrelevant audiences (such as existing customers and those who cannot purchase), acquire new customers more effectively to drive growth, and upsell or cross-sell additional products to existing customers.

£1 million saved on paid acquisition campaigns+43% more conversions and 37% lower cost per order+38% higher click rate
“Based on my experience, I can honestly say Zeotap’s platform is without equal. Brands can happily jettison a complex and inefficient patchwork of point solutions in favour of their unified stack for all data-related activities.”
