USE CASE 2
Trigger messages
Automatically sending messages to customers based on specific actions or events creates a better, more personalised customer experience. Trigger events, like a birthday or an approaching subscription renewal, help identify when a customer is likely interested in a product or service. Marketers can use these events to send targeted messages in real-time or schedule them for future delivery.
