How DOUGLAS maximised its data potential with Zeotap CDP
Douglas urgently needed a vendor that could ensure top-tier data safety and privacy, offer user-friendly solutions with swift integrations, and provide a collaborative and trust-based partnership.
Main goalsAchieve a comprehensive 360-brand activationInternationalise and explore new secure channelsEstablish a robust data and adtech architectureTransition from DMP to CDP for improved targeting in a future without 3P cookies
"We chose Zeotap CDP for three key factors. Foremost was the assurance of safety and privacy - a shared philosophy deeply ingrained in our German vendor's DNA, ensuring our client data is protected at all costs. Ease of use was another crucial element; the most sophisticated tools are ineffective if they aren't user-friendly and embraced by our teams. The third aspect was urgency – the need to get started swiftly, prioritizing out-of-the-box integrations and connectors. Lastly, the human factor played a vital role: effective communication, collaborative interaction, and mutual trust were paramount in our decision-making process."
