inefficient patchwork of point solutions in favour of their unified stack for all data-related activities."

security. We believe Zeotap - with its roots in Germany - is an
expert and reliable partner to help navigate the first-party data
opportunity."

Understand your customers
Every marketer wants faster, clearer insight into their customers – and to be able to take action on it immediately. Predictive Audiences places insights about your ‘best’ and ‘worst’ customers at your fingertips – and is connected to all your martech and adtech stack for you to action in seconds.
Decrease churn and attrition
Identifying the signs of churn in time to save a customer is notoriously difficult – with Predictive Audiences, you can identify your customer segments at risk of churn and apply them to campaigns to win them back in just a few clicks.
Increase ROAS
Effective return on advertising spend is increasingly challenging, so having accurate target audiences is critical. Predictive Audiences pinpoint those audiences most likely to convert, giving you a shortcut to ROAS without needing trial-and-error.
