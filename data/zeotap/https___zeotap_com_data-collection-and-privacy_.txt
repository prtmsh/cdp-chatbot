How a 360-degree customer view impacts your business growth
Marketers need to gather and update consented data across all customer touchpoints to build trust and respect privacy concerns. This approach not only boosts conversions and sales but also helps avoid costly GDPR fines and protects brand reputation.
USE CASE 1
Customer data aggregation
To drive onsite and offsite monetisation, marketers need to combine browsing and in-store purchase data. By using omnichannel customer data and a customer 360 data model, they can understand customer behavior and preferences better. With customer data aggregation and first-party data collection, customer attributes are linked under a unique ID, allowing for personalised marketing strategies and effective measurement of cross-channel promotions.

USE CASE 2
Data compliance
The EU GDPR gives residents strong data rights, like the right to be forgotten. Zeotap helps optimise customer experiences to meet data privacy compliance, including GDPR and CCPA. It allows quick responses to data requests, including one-click deletion of customer records. Zeotap CDP stores and manages consent purposes and marketing preferences, creating actionable, compliant audience segments for data privacy solutions in marketing campaigns.
