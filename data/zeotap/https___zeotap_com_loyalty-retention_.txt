USE CASE 1
Churn prevention
Use CDP data such as transaction history, engagement metrics, and customer demographics to create models that help with churn prevention. Zeotap CDP stores the models on customer profiles to help better understand customer behaviour and preferences. Real-time data processing then enables taking proactive steps and intervening immediately to prevent churn. Marketers can create targeted personalised experiences that will keep customers engaged and reduce churn risk, leading to a higher customer lifetime value.
USE CASE 2
Pre-emptive customer support
Help customers before they call for help with pre-emptive customer support. Zeotap CDP receives data on customer behaviour, such as web pages visited and system error messages. This data can be used to identify customers who are likely to need help and provide suitable support. It also enables the integration of support channels such as chatbots or self-service portals for immediate assistance. With this, Zeotap CDP makes support scalable across different touchpoints, leading to reduced costs and improved customer satisfaction.
USE CASE 3
Retention campaigns
Ensure customer retention with optimal communications throughout the buyer journey – for example with targeted messages such as renewal reminders, special offers, or loyalty rewards. In Zeotap CDP, marketers can build customer segments for retention campaigns based on purchase history, engagement level, or product preferences. They can create rules that automatically send messages triggered by specified times or events to certain audiences. Performance metrics such as conversion rates or customer lifetime value (CLV) show the success of the campaigns.
