What our customers say
"Based on my experience, I can honestly say Zeotap’s platform is without equal. Brands can happily jettison a complex and
inefficient patchwork of point solutions in favour of their unified stack for all data-related activities."
Kay SchwabedalChief Digital Officer, Virgin Media O2
"Zeotap has always set the bar when it comes to quality and security. It is part of their DNA."
Steffen Roehnformer CIO, Deutsche Telekom
"Being the data centre for the entire EMEA region, we have found Zeotap to be the right partner to improve our customer data intelligence and the service we provide to our clients."
Jordi UrbeaChief Revenue Officer, Ogilvy
"Zeotap is a strategic partner of Google Cloud in EMEA, driving
additional value and improved experience for our customers with
GCP. We realise that leveraging first-party data to drive digital
transformation and omni-channel personalisation is top of mind for
retailers - while also ensuring the best-possible privacy and
security. We believe Zeotap - with its roots in Germany - is an
expert and reliable partner to help navigate the first-party data
opportunity."
Adaire Martin-FoxPresident of Google Cloud International and Head of Google Ireland
