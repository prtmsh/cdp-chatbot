inefficient patchwork of point solutions in favour of their unified stack for all data-related activities."

Jordi UrbeaChief Revenue Officer, Ogilvy
"Zeotap is a strategic partner of Google Cloud in EMEA, driving
additional value and improved experience for our customers with

expert and reliable partner to help navigate the first-party data
opportunity."
