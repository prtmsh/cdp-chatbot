Collecting Data Seamlessly: Capture customer information from every interaction, whether online or in-store, to ensure no valuable insight is overlooked.Building Unified Customer Profiles: Consolidate this data to break down silos and form comprehensive profiles, providing a complete view of each customer.Segmenting with Ease: Organise your customers into groups based on their preferences, behaviours, and demographics for more effective targeting.Activating Across Channels: Apply these segments to customise your marketing across various channels, making sure your communications are always relevant and engaging. Monitoring and Adapting: Continuously monitor how customers interact with your brand in real-time and adapt your strategies to respond to changing demands promptly.
Top 5 CDP use cases for retailers
By leveraging a robust CDP and its comprehensive customer insights, retailers can achieve a myriad of objectives, from recovering abandoned carts to enhancing customer loyalty. Explore below to learn how a CDP can revolutionise your retail operations across various key areas.
Recover Abandoned Carts
Retailers face challenges in understanding customer behaviour and recovering lost sales due to cart abandonment. Personalised follow-up strategies, like email reminders and incentives, help re-engage customers and recover lost sales.Why It Matters: Analysing customer data can uncover pain points and cart abandonment patterns. Personalised follow-ups based on behaviour and demographics can drive conversions and recover lost sales. Understanding these insights is crucial for retailers to craft effective strategies, making a CDP invaluable.Zeotap Success Story: A leading retailer faced the challenge of understanding customer behaviour and recovering lost sales due to cart abandonment. Crafted for precision, Zeotap CDP utilised user behaviour data to create comprehensive customer profiles, which were then used to craft personalised journeys effortlessly through the intuitive interface. Using automated triggers, the retailer enabled strategic re-engagement across multiple channels, driving conversions and fostering lasting customer loyalty. The implementation resulted in a remarkable 15% increase in conversion rates with personalised email reminders, and an impressive 42% of inactive users returned after receiving personalised offers.
Increase Average Order Value (AOV)
Retailers aim to boost AOV by encouraging customers to add more items to their shopping carts. Personalised product recommendations enhance the shopping experience, leading to higher conversions and AOV.Why It Matters: Offering personalised incentives like discounts or free shipping can create opportunities for upselling and cross-selling strategies. By leveraging algorithms and customer data through a CDP, retailers can tailor recommendations to individual preferences, driving exploration of additional items and increasing AOV.Zeotap Success Story: A retailer faced the challenge of enhancing the shopping experience to drive higher conversions and increase AOV. Zeotap CDP's precision-crafted solution seamlessly consolidated user behaviour and purchase data to create nuanced customer profiles. These profiles were enriched with diverse data points, comprising both Customer and Non-Customer Entity Data, including product catalogues and order data. They effortlessly segmented high-value customers, facilitating personalised offerings and member programs through precise cross-channel targeting strategies. The outcome was remarkable: a 30% increase in the Cost Order Turnover Ratio and a 46% surge in Average Shopping Cart Value.
Re-engage Inactive Users
Understanding why users become inactive is crucial for retailers. Reconnecting with abandoned cart customers and inactive users is essential to prevent churn and regain lost revenue.Why It Matters: Examining customer data to identify reasons for inactivity can help in deploying targeted campaigns that offer incentives or personalised recommendations, encouraging customers to complete purchases. Leveraging a CDP to identify high-intent actions can trigger messages to push inactive customers toward conversion. Zeotap CDP Success Story: A Retailer wanted to understand why some of the users became inactive. Zeotap CDP, tailored for accuracy, aggregated user behaviour and purchase data, offering a 360-degree customer view. Leveraging this, the retailer identified reasons for inactivity and deployed targeted campaigns, driving a remarkable 20% increase in conversion rates. By analysing inactive user browsing behaviour, Zeotap CDP enables personalised recommendations, resulting in 35% of inactive users returning to make purchases. This approach not only prevents churn but also revitalised lost revenue, showcasing the power of data-driven re-engagement strategies.
Retain Customers and Improve Loyalty
Retailers often prioritise repeat purchases over genuine customer loyalty with outdated programs. However, by tailoring digital content and experiences, along with personalised incentives, they can foster stronger bonds and enhance long-term loyalty.Why It Matters: Retail shoppers seek convenience but may find the shipping process daunting. Loyalty programs, powered by tailored content, elevate the shopping experience and drive repeat purchases. With a CDP, retailers can track and leverage customer data to deliver relevant messages across channels, enhancing customer retention.Zeotap Success Story: A retailer wanted to foster stronger bonds with the customer and enhance long-term loyalty.

Suppress Existing Customers from Irrelevant Ads
Retailers strive to enhance marketing effectiveness by ensuring ads are relevant to existing customers. Outdated systems often lead to annoyance with irrelevant ads, wasting ad spend and reducing future effectiveness. Suppressing existing customers from irrelevant ads is crucial to enhance satisfaction and campaign impact.Why It Matters: Personalised strategies, powered by a CDP and advanced algorithms, can enable retailers to exclude customers who have already purchased specific products from receiving redundant ads. Targeted messages deployed when customers are most receptive drive additional purchases without overwhelming them with irrelevant ads.Zeotap CDP Success Story: A retailer faced the challenge of ensuring ad relevance to existing customers, as their outdated systems often resulted in annoyance with irrelevant ads, wasting ad spend.
