About Us
Easy, secure andimpactful customer data
Our vision At Zeotap, we envision a future in which businesses can deliver personalised and data-driven customer experiences while putting customer privacy at the front and centre. We are dedicated to helping brands monetise their customer data and achieve commercial outcomes with ease. To achieve this, we have developed and offer must-have software and data solutions to support our customers in achieving their desired business outcomes across marketing, sales, and customer service. We differentiate ourselves by providing addressability in customer data, an easy-to-use platform that drives faster results with data privacy, and compliance heart supported by best-in-class customer support.
History
Zeotap was born in Berlin in 2014 to provide high-quality data to marketers and soon recognised a bigger challenge: brands needed to create multi-channel personalised experiences. But doing so required a means to action customer data in a world that prioritises privacy and compliance. And so, in 2020, we launched our Customer Data Platform (CDP), a natively integrated SaaS suite built on the Google Cloud Platform.
Today, Zeotap offers two products:
The easy, secure and impactful Customer Data Platform that empowers brands to integrate, unify, segment and orchestrate customer data.
It’s people-based, deterministic data composed of over 500 million unique IDs. Zeotap Data is fully-consented, GDPR and ePrivacy compliant.
Zeotap's history timeline
2014Zeotap was born to build a business, capitalising on all of the data held by telecom companies. This was achieved by selling said data to advertising agencies by integrating them into DSPs.
2016The company continued to grow and expand through client acquisition and investment, continually adding new data partners and expanding into new industries beyond.
2017We achieved higher goals by building a proprietary stitching algorithm, unifying data from different sources, assigning a unique ID to them, and creating a single ‘golden record.’
2019Most companies realised the value of leveraging their first-party data, and many CDPs emerged. An opportunity arose to use our many years of experience in this market, and expand the Zeotap offering.
2020We built our Customer Data Platform (CDP), a natively integrated SaaS suite built on the Google Cloud Platform
2023We have 70+ clients, 180+ employees, the 5 largest telecom companies, over 50+ recurring clients across Europe, and are associated with top brands like Audi, Johnson & Johnson, Mc Donalds, Sky and Virgin Media. We presently have 120 data sources, all real-time and GDPR-audited data.
Why the name Zeotap?Our name combines two words: “Zeo” and “tap”. “Zeo” comes from “Zeolite,” a mineral that transforms crude oil into everyday essentials, like high-quality fuel which makes crude oil usable and precious which enables societies to develop. It also purifies oxygen from the air by trapping impurities. In our case, our technology transforms customer data to be addressable and actionable the way “Zeolite” transforms crude oil. Hence, the word “Zeo” symbolises our ability to help businesses get the most impactful results from their data at ease and scale, just like opening a tap and letting it flow.
So, Zeotap means empowering brands to get the best from their data—easily and securely.
Why a triangle?
Our Symbol is a triangle with rounded sides. Each side represents a different founding element of our company:
Customers
Data
Privacy
Our triangle rests on the base side, not the corners; this shows our business’ stability and our customers’ trust.
Our valuesOur values define who we are and how we work daily with customers, prospects, and team members. We let them come through in all that we do!
PioneerDare to be different
We are not afraid to take risks and think outside the box. We are always looking for new and better ways to do things. We want to push boundaries and deliver value through innovation and creativity.
AdaptiveChange is always an opportunity
We remain flexible and responsive to changing circumstances. We are open to new ideas and approaches, as well as listen to understand the perspectives of others. We are willing to learn and grow from new experiences.
Challenger We think, act, and win above our weight class
We take on challenges that others may consider impossible to solve. A strong sense of ownership and a desire to succeed drive us. We put in the hard work and effort necessary to achieve our goals.
TrustworthyActions speak louder than words
We consistently act with integrity and accountability and focus on value creation for our colleagues and customers. We take pride in doing the right thing, even when it may be difficult. We stay true to our word and deliver on commitments.
