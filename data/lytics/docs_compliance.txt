This guide provides instructions on how to delete a profile from Lytics via the Lytics UI. In addition, you can use the Lytics API to delete a customer profile. A successful deletion request of a profile using the Lytics API will not update the status of a customer in the Lytics UI until the profile has been removed from Lytics.
The removal is handled in background batch processes that will be fulfilled within 14 days.
