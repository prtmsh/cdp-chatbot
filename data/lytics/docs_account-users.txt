User Profile
To access your profile, click "Manage My User" from the account menu at the bottom of the primary navigation.
You'll have access to personal information and usage statistics from the resulting profile page. It doubles as an ID card and a stats card.
You can edit your name and email address. Both fields are required. A phone number is only required for 2FA.
Click the "Change Password" button to change your password.
Resetting Passwords
The password must be reset by the user whose password is being reset. Passwords cannot be reset on behalf of others.
To reset your password, go to Manage My Profile in the account menu and click the Change Password button.
A modal will open, prompting for a new password can be entered.
ðŸš§Changing a password will immediately invalidate all current sessions across all machines for the user.
Managing Account Users
Click "Manage Users" in the account menu to manage account users.
Modifying User Permissions
User roles define the amount of access and permissions a Lytics user has when logged in and through the Lytics APIs.
A user may have any number of these roles, and the permissions for multiple roles are additive. For example, a user with the Campaign Manager and Content Manager roles will have access to all permissions granted by both roles.
Users with the Admin role can control other users' roles within your organization via the "Manage Users" option from the account dropdown menu.
Managing Personally Identifiable Information
You can indicate any user fields in your account that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) via the private fields account setting. These fields will be hidden for anyone who does not have Admin, Data Manager, or User Search roles. You should verify with Lytics Support that the field hiding in the segment scan is also enabled for your account to ensure these fields are hidden there.
What does a user of each role have access to?
A user's role determines which parts of the Lytics app they can access. Here is a breakdown of what is shown in the navigation for each role.

For access to look-a-like models you will need to be an account admin or have a combination of Discovery Insight + a role that gives access to Jobs/Auths.
What tasks can a user of each role perform?
Roles define a set of permissions the user has, which also dictates what actions they can take in the app and through the APIs. Here is a breakdown of the permissions for each role by feature.
Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
To shield PI from users who should not have access, you will need to use the private fields account setting to mark the profile fields you want to hide from anyone who does not have Admin, Data Manager, or User Search roles.

Inviting Users
