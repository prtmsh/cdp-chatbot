profiles enjoy access to both a universal schema, which provides computed, intelligent attributes on every profile in Lytics, as well as a common schema, a set of standard attributes that facilitates faster integration and more reliable consistency when integrating profiles to and from other systems.
Growth and Enterprise Lytics accounts may also customize their schema with additional fields and mappings.
Universal Schema
Lytics' universal schema delivers a set of intelligent attributes that are universal to every profile that gets created, regardless of data source, age, or their anonymous or known status.
These attributes include rich behavioral models, AI-derived interests, and identity resolution metadata, leading to more comprehensive insights on all of your profiles.
(Not just the known ones!)
Universal attributes provide a common vocabulary with which to think about how you might engage with each and every individual — what they're interested in, what their engagement has been, or how they're likely to engage in the future.
Identifiers
Identifiers in Lytics Schema serve to stitch profiles together. For instance, if you pass an email along with the _uid, all events that have only been associated with either identifier will be merged into a single comprehensive profile.
Default identifiers are listed below.
Some jobs in your data pipeline may add new identifiers to your schema, like shopify_customer_id or salesforce_contact_ids.
FieldShort DescriptionLong DescriptionExample_idLytics IDA unique ID that represents the materialized profile in Lytics."4fafb5b3-b199-58f2-a68b-4b266b363dd1"
Metafields
Metafields encompass all system-level information that provides insights into the health and breadth of the profile. This includes data such as creation date, last update timestamp, source information, and other metadata associated with the profile's management and maintenance. Metafields offer a behind-the-scenes view of the profile's overall status and administration.
FieldShort DescriptionLong DescriptionExample_createdCreatedThe time a profile was created."2024-02-28T02:45:51.377423153Z"_last_scoredLast Scored TimestampThe time a profile was last scored by Lytics."2024-02-28T02:45:51.377423153Z"_modifiedModified TimestampThe time a profile was last modified by Lytics."2024-02-28T02:45:51.377423153Z"_num_aliasesNumber of AliasesThe number of aliases for a profile, as calculated by Lytics' Identity Resolution.5_num_daysNumber of DaysThe number of distinct days a profile has had activity.3_num_eventsNumber of EventsThe total number of events processed for a profile.81_num_streamsNumber of StreamsThe number of distinct data streams in which a profile has been present.2_streamnamesStream NamesThe distinct streams in which a profile has been present.["default"]
Behavioral
Behavioral attributes comprise a multidimensional set of scores that provide insight into an individual's behavior over time.
These insights are invaluable when personalizing experiences based on changes in behavior or behaviors indicative of high likelihood. For instance, you might want to present a premium offer to users exhibiting higher momentum than usual.
Behavioral attributes enable targeted and timely interventions tailored to user actions and patterns.
FieldShort DescriptionLong DescriptionExamplescore_consistencyConsistencyMeasures the long-term consistency of a typical user's daily engagement.56score_frequencyFrequencyMeasures the frequency of a user's engagement, relative to your most frequent users.74score_intensityIntensityMeasures the depth of a typical user's daily engagement.3score_maturityMaturityMeasures the length of a user's history, relative to your most mature users.97score_momentumMomentumMeasures the rate at which user engagement is changing.45score_propensityPropensityMeasures how likely a user is to re-engage with more activity.91score_quantityQuantityMeasures the quantity of a user's engagement, relative to your most frequent users.12score_recencyRecencyMeasures the recency (over a 1 year window) of a user's engagement.28score_volatilityVolatilityMeasures the long-term volatility of the depth of a typical user's daily engagement.63
Interests
Interests entail understanding the topics a user is interested in based on their interactions, cross-referenced by deep programmatic analysis of their online activities. This allows for tailored content recommendations and targeted messaging aligned with the user's preferences and engagement history.
FieldShort DescriptionLong DescriptionExamplelytics_contentLytics ContentA map of topic-level interests for the user.{"Shoes":0.76,"Pants":0.43}
Intelligence
Attributes classified as intelligence encompass diverse, highly valuable information to facilitate relevant and high-value personalized experiences. Within this category, you'll discover real-time segment membership, values crucial for split testing and experimentation, and direct correlation to our real-time machine learning modeling. These attributes empower dynamic and data-driven decision-making, enhancing the efficacy of personalized marketing strategies.
FieldShort DescriptionLong DescriptionExample_segmentsSegment MembershipThe segments or audiences of which on individual is a member.["all", "anonymous_profiles", "smt_power"]_splitRandom Split 1A randomly assigned value for making randomized audiences and driving experiments.0_split2Random Split 2A randomly assigned value for making randomized audiences and driving experiments.99segment_predictionLytics Predictive ScoresScores from Lytics SegmentML Predictive Models.{"likely_to_buy_shoes": 0.47}segment_prediction_percentileLytics Preditive PercentilesPercentiles from Lytics SegmentML Predictive Models.{"likely_to_buy_shoes": 91}
_split
Random splits are assigned by algorithmic hashing and result in an even distribution across profiles.
There are 100 possible splits (0-99), so creating an audience where _split = 44 would result in a random subset of 1% of profiles.
A random split where _split < 50 would result in a subset of 50% of profiles.
_split2
Having access to two random split assignments allows you to target 100*100, or 10k different subsets of your audiences.
This means you can create splits that are capable of targeting down to 0.01% of profiles.
segment_prediction
Lytics' SegmentML models provide scores for modeling custom outcomes in Lookalike models.
Each active model attaches a score (between 0 and 1) to a profile with its name.
segment_prediction_percentile
Similar to segment_prediction values, the percentiles provide the ability to create audiences and target users based on their percentile instead of their raw score.
This enables you, for example, to create audiences of users with the top 10% of scores (by using segment_prediction_percentile > 90).
Common Schema
Common fields help to structure your profiles in a way for developers to easily plug into them, and for marketers to easily use them in personalization.
Common mappings help to translate your source data into a format that can be used by common fields.
These fields and mappings help to provide consistency in your profiles, regardless of the source from which the data came.
For example, your CRM might have "tax_exempt": "true", while your data warehouse might has "tax_status": "exempt", and your ESP might have "is_tax_exempt": 1.
In Lytics' Common Schema, this would simply be represented as "tax_exempt": true.
Pre-defined Mappings
For your convenience, Jobs managed in your Data Pipeline will automatically create schema fields and mappings to implement Lytics Common Schema in your data so that you can get to more use cases more quickly with our Inspiration Library.
Some fields, like name, are automatically part of every Lytics account.
Other channel-specific fields will be added when you add channel-specific data sources to your account. For example, adding a Shopify import job to your data sources would add the common schema field purchase_total, among others.
Identifiers
Identifiers in Lytics Schema serve to stitch profiles together. For instance, if you pass an email along with the _uid, all events that have only been associated with either identifier will be merged into a single comprehensive profile.
Default identifiers are listed below.
Some jobs in your data pipeline may add new identifiers to your schema, like shopify_customer_id or salesforce_contact_ids.

email_sha256
The SHA256 hash of an individual's email address.
In the event that your account has an email address present, the hash is automatically computed so as to be compatible with external systems that require the SHA256 hash for integration.
In the event that you don't want any PII in your account, you can pass the hash directly instead of the raw address.

Interests
Interests entail understanding the topics a user is interested in based on their interactions, cross-referenced by deep programmatic analysis of their online activities. This allows for tailored content recommendations and targeted messaging aligned with the user's preferences and engagement history.
FieldShort DescriptionLong DescriptionExamplehashedurlsHashed URLsA map of URLs an individual has engaged with, indexed by each URL's hashed value.{"hashedurls":{"4058474390481920149":5,"680176754148162020":2}}
hashedurls
A history of an individual's most recently visited URLs, helpful for powering Lytics' Interest Engines. A siphash of each URL's sanitized value (without query parameters) is used to index the map.
hashedurls are used in Lytics' standard Interest Engine, but you can create additional Interest Engines with other sets of URLs, product IDs, or atomic content IDs from your CMS.

FieldShort DescriptionLong DescriptionExamplenext_eventNext EventStream-specific preditions for the timestamp of the next expected interaction on a stream.``needs_messageNeeds MessageStream-specific score to predict how much an individual "needs" a message on a data stream.``
needs_message
The "needs message" score evaluates how likely an individual is to engage on a channel without any messaging.
A higher score would indicate that an individual is less likely to return within a typical engagement window (relative to other individuals in a data stream).
A lower score would indicate that they are more likely to return within a typical engagement window.
Details
Details encompass all default attributes related to user demographics and general information, including name, phone number, status, etc. It serves as a catch-all for attributes not specifically tied to interactions or behaviors.
