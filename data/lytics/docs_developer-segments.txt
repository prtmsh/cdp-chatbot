users based on their behaviors and characteristics is pivotal for effective audience targeting and personalization strategies. Lytics audience segmentation offers a powerful tool for organizing users into meaningful groups based on shared attributes or behaviors. This section provides a comprehensive overview of all audience segments that are provided out-of-the-box.
Available Segments (Audiences)
üëçLytics audience segments apply predefined rules to each user profile as they update. Membership in these segments is maintained in real-time and can trigger subsequent actions when users enter or exit the segment.
The following audience segments are all available out of the box, with no customization necessary in all Lytics pricing tiers.
