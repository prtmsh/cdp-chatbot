offers a wide range of pre-packaged user attributes, including automatically generated and customizable ones. Additionally, Lytics employs predictive modeling and machine learning algorithms to provide insights and scores, allowing users to gain a deeper understanding of their audience. The guide below provides an overview of all available attributes and examples to enhance your profiling efforts.
üëçIf you haven't already reviewed our documentation on collecting events via our JavaScript SDK, we highly recommend doing so first. This will give you a better understanding of how data collection works at a high level before delving into the specifics of what can be collected.
Available Attributes
The following attributes are all available out of the box with no customization necessary in all Lytics pricing tiers. Do note that any attributes flagged as Computed can not be edited directly but are computed based on various factors, including other non-computed attributes.
üìòFor a more comprehensive example of how any of the following attributes can be collected and used for your visitors click the name of the identifier to access the code examples below.
Identifiers
Default attributes that are used to stitch profiles together. For instance, if you pass an email along with the _uid, all events that have only been associated with either identifier will be merged into a single comprehensive profile.

Details
Details encompass all default attributes related to user demographics and general information, including name, phone number, status, etc. It serves as a catch-all for attributes not specifically tied to interactions or behaviors.

Meta
Meta encompasses all system-level information that provides insights into the health and breadth of the profile. This includes data such as creation date, last update timestamp, source information, and other metadata associated with the profile's management and maintenance. Metadata offers a behind-the-scenes view of the profile's overall status and administration.

Behavior
Behavioral attributes typically cannot be directly managed but represent a set of insights derived from a user's behavior over time. These insights are invaluable when personalizing experiences based on changes in behavior or behaviors indicative of high likelihood. For instance, you might want to present a premium offer to users exhibiting higher momentum than usual. Behavioral attributes enable targeted and timely interventions tailored to user actions and patterns.
NameSlugDescriptionComputedExampleConsistencyscore_consistencyScore representing how consistent their activity patterns are.Yes99Frequencyscore_frequencyA score representing how frequently the user is active.Yes63Intensityscore_intensityA score representing how intense the user's activity is.Yes94Maturityscore_maturityA score representing how mature the user's activity is.Yes34Momentumscore_momentumA score representing how much momentum the user currently has.Yes54Propensityscore_propensityA score representing how likely the user is to engage again.Yes1Quantityscore_quantityA score representing how much activity the user has.Yes99Recencyscore_recencyA score representing how recent the user's activity is.Yes99Volatilityscore_volatilityA score representing the degree of variability in behavior.Yes99
Interests
Interests entail understanding the topics a user is interested in based on their interactions, cross-referenced by deep programmatic analysis of their online activities. This allows for tailored content recommendations and targeted messaging aligned with the user's preferences and engagement history.
NameSlugDescriptionComputedExampleLytics Contentlytics_contentA map of topic-level interests for the user.Yes{"Baking": 0.26418695138978837}
Intelligence
Attributes classified as intelligence encompass diverse, highly valuable information to facilitate relevant and high-value personalized experiences. Within this category, you'll discover real-time segment membership, values crucial for split testing and experimentation, and direct correlation to our real-time machine learning modeling. These attributes empower dynamic and data-driven decision-making, enhancing the efficacy of personalized marketing strategies.

Behavior
The following attributes are all computed in real-time as the profile evolves. Each of the behavioral attributes are surfaced as a score between 0 and 100. These scores represent an aggregate summary of the user's behavior across various dimensions: Consistency, Frequency, Intensity, Maturity, Momentum, Propensity, Quantity, Recency, and Volatility.
Interests
Lytics Content (lytics_content)
The interest attributes are computed in real-time and represent the user's interest in various topics. These topics are generated as a result of the analysis done by the Lytics Interest Engine and then associated with the user based upon their interaction with content on your site.
Intelligence
Segment Membership (_segments)
This attribute displays an array of all segments the user is currently a member of. It updates in real-time based on various audience definitions. Lytics offers a range of useful segments out of the box, requiring no additional setup. For detailed information on these audiences, refer to our Developer Tier > Audiences documentation.
Split & Split2 (_split & _split2)
These attributes are automatically generated by Lytics and represent a random value evenly distributed across users. They are useful for split testing and experimentation.

By default Lytics will collect a pv event for each page view and this will automatically populate the first_seen and last_seen attributes. Below is an example of collecting a custom event that would populate these attributes as well.
