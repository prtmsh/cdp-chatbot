Content Setup Suggest EditsLytics' Interest Engines effectively analyze your content with minimal effort required. However, to guarantee that the classification results align with your expectations, conducting a quick test is advisable, as poor metadata can sometimes lead to less-than-optimal outcomes. The most reliable method to ensure comprehensive and satisfactory content classification is to classify a selection of your URLs manually.
Use the left-hand navigation to select Content > Classification.
Click on the section labeled Classify, then paste a URL from your website and press Classify.
After a moment or two, a set of preliminary classification details will come back. Most notably, ensure the Title, Primary Image, and Topics come back with content. If they do not, please refer to our
full documentation for configuring content and meta tags.
