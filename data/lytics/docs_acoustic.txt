Acoustic (previously known as Silverpop) is a marketing platform that enables email, SMS, and mobile campaigns, among other marketing analytics and automation solutions.
Integrating Lytics with Acoustic allows you to import users and their activity data to build behavioral audiences and gain Insights in Lytics. You can then export Lytics audiences back to Acoustic to refine your targeting and deliver personalized messaging.
Authorization
If you have not done so already, you will need to set up an Acoustic account before you begin the process described below. Your Acoustic account user must have permission to create Application Access via the API.
Select Acoustic from the list of providers.
Select the Full Auth method for authorization.
Enter a Label to identify your authorization.
(Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your authorization.
Enter your Client ID for the application that you have created in your Acoustic account. For more information, please refer to Acoustic Documentation.
Enter the Client Secret for your entered Client ID.
Enter the Pod number of your Acoustic Campaign. You can find the Pod information in Account Setting page of your Acoustic account. For example, if it is Pod 2 then just enter 2.

Enter your SFTP Username for the Acoustic Account.
Enter your SFTP Password for the above SFTP User. You can use your own credentials here, or create a new user for this integration.
Click Save Authorization.
ðŸ“˜For this integration, it is recommended to create a new Acoustic User specific for Lytics with the option Do not enforce password expiration policies for this user selected so the authentication is long lasting, and can be revoked on an account by account basis.
Import Audiences & Activity
Import Acoustic users and their activity information into Lytics so you can leverage that data to build behavioral audiences and gain Insights powered by Lytics data science.
Integration Details
Implementation Type: Server-side Integration.
Implementation Technique: XML API Integration to download CSV formatted data.
Frequency:
Data is imported as a Batch Integration; imported once, or every 8 hours on a continuous basis.
Resulting Data: Full Lytics user profiles for all Acoustic users complete with activity data.
This integration utilizes the Acoustic XML API to import Acoustic users and their activity to Lytics. Each run of the job will proceed as follows:
Exports users from the selected Acoustic Database as a CSV file to an Acoustic-manged SFTP server. The CSV files are then read and imported to the silverpop_users stream in Lytics.
Exports email activity from users in the selected Acoustic Database as a CSV file to an Acoustic-manged SFTP server. The CSV files are then read and imported to the silverpop_activity stream in Lytics.
After successful completion, the job will import new/updated users with their updated activity every 8 hours if configured to run continuously.
Fields
The following fields are included in the default mapping for the silverpop_users stream. Note this integration was formerly named Silverpop, hence the data stream name, but this job will receive your current Acoustic data.
