Companies use Mixpanel to analyze how & why users engage, convert, and retain in real-time on web, mobile, and IoT devices, and then use the data to improve their products.
Overview & Prerequisites
If you are new to setting up Mixpanel’s Mobile App Analytics, your best place to start is Mixpanel itself and the below are must-reads before proceeding:
Mobile App Analytics Setup Overview: https://mixpanel.com/help/reference
Best Practices for setting up your events: https://mixpanel.com/help/reference/ios#sending-events
When mParticle sends data to Mixpanel, Mixpanel’s APIs are utilized.
This allows mParticle to implement server side data forwarding and supports our value proposition to customers of not requiring that additional app SDK components be continually added and updated for integrations.
In order to enable mParticle’s integration with Mixpanel, you will need an account with Mixpanel and have your Mixpanel Token for mParticle configuration. Your Mixpanel Token can be found at the Mixpanel topic, Find Project Token.
It is important to ensure that your mParticle data implementation plan captures the correct instrumentation scheme to map to your desired Mixpanel feature sets. In other words, depending upon what Mixpanel feature set you decide to implement, may drive some of how you structure your app with the mParticle SDK.
Data Processing Notes
User and Event attributes with string values of "true" or "false" (not case sensitive), will be converted to boolean values before being forwarded to Mixpanel.
Supported Features
mParticle’s SDK supports nearly all of the Mixpanel SDK specific features natively. When you use the mParticle SDK, mParticle events will be transformed using Mixpanel-compliant naming conventions and activate the corresponding features automatically.

User Identification
One of the key features of Mixpanel is funnel tracking, this feature requires a consistent approach to identifying your users as they sign up, and progress from being only identifiable by their device, to having a unique “logged in” ID.
mParticle manages this process using its IDSync feature. IDSync gives you granular control over how user profiles are managed. To support IDSync, mParticle maintains a hierarchy of different ID types.
A traditional Mixpanel implementation, using the Mixpanel SDK, manages sign-up funnels by using the following process:
When a user first downloads your app, the Distinct ID is set using a default anonymous device id (Apple Advertising ID for iOS, a random GUID for Android, a Cookie ID for Web).
When you know the identity of the current user, typically after log-in or sign-up, you call Mixpanel’s identify method. Mixpanel recommends against using identify for anonymous visitors to your site.
If your project has Mixpanel’s ID Merge feature enabled, the call to identify will connect pre- and post-authentication events when appropriate.
If your project does not have ID Merge enabled, identify will change the user’s local distinct_id to the unique ID you pass. Events tracked prior to authentication will not be connected to the same user identity. If ID Merge is disabled,
Alias can be used to tie the original Distinct ID (an anonymous device ID) and the new Distinct ID (a unique User ID) together in Mixpanel.
If this process is not followed correctly, funnel tracking won’t be possible, as Mixpanel will see the two Distinct IDs as two completely separate users.
If you wish to use Mixpanel’s funnel tracking features, here is one option for implementing with mParticle:
Option 1 - Use mParticle ID as the Distinct ID
This option is recommended for new implementations. This option lets your Mixpanel user profiles mirror those maintained by mParticle. This option lets your mParticle Identity strategy take care of aliasing for you, before your data ever reaches Mixpanel.
For this to work, you need to have selected an Identity Strategy that supports funnel tracking, such as the Profile Conversion Strategy. If you use the Profile Conversion Strategy and mParticle’s Customer ID as your logged-in ID type, a sign-up flow works as follows:
When a user first downloads your app, mParticle creates a new user profile, with a new, unique mParticle ID. mParticle immediately begins forwarding event data to Mixpanel, mapping the mParticle ID to Mixpanel’s Distinct ID.
When the user creates an account, and you add a Customer ID, mParticle associates the new Customer ID with the original user profile. Now you have a new way of identifying users in the mParticle SDK, the mParticle ID — mapped to Mixpanel as the Distinct ID — which never changes.
To use this option, set the External Identity Type to mParticle ID in the Configuration Settings.
Note that this example is the minimum necessary to demonstrate the required sign-up flow and does not include additional features, such as completion handlers. Refer to the full Identity documentation:

Event Tracking
Tracking standard events in the mParticle SDK is fairly straightforward. Events can be standalone or include event attributes. mParticle attributes are converted to Mixpanel properties automatically when forwarded.
Mixpanel’s SDK Method
mParticle’s SDK Method
track with properties
logEvent with event attributes or logEcommerceTransactionWithProduct
track with no properties
logScreen or logEvent with no event attributes
Historical Event Tracking
mParticle sends data to different Mixpanel endpoints depending on the age of the events:
Events that are less than or equal to 5 days old are sent to the track endpoint.
Events that are greater than 5 days old are sent to the import endpoint.
In order for mParticle to send the historical data to Mixpanel, you must provide the API Secret. If not provided, mParticle will drop these events.
Super Property Tracking
Super properties allow certain properties that you want to include with each event you send. Generally, these are things you know about the user rather than about a specific event, for example, the user’s age, gender, or source. These super properties will be automatically included with all tracked events. Super properties are saved to device storage, and will persist across invocations of your app.
Mixpanel’s SDK Method
mParticle’s SDK Method
Description
registerSuperProperties
SetUserAttribute
Super properties, once registered, are automatically sent for all even tracking calls.
registerSuperPropertiesOnce
Not supported
Setting User Properties and Attribute Mapping
Both Mixpanel and mParticle have the ability to set specific attributes for the user which will persist until overwritten.
Mixpanel’s SDK Method
mParticle’s SDK Method
Description
set
SetUserAttribute
Sets a single property with the given name and value for this group.
If you have enabled the ‘Include User Attributes’ setting, then any messages with type ScreenView or AppEvent will include the email user identity (if available) and all user attributes.
The SetUserAttribute method can be used to set user attributes. This method will overwrite the values of any existing user attributes.
Attribute Mappings
mParticle’s attribute naming conventions closely resemble standard Mixpanel attributes, which a few exceptions:
mParticle attribute
will be changed to
$FirstName
$first_name
$LastName
$last_name
$Mobile
$phone
These mParticle attributes will just have the leading $ removed:
mParticle attribute
will be changed to
$Gender
Gender
$Age
Age
$Country
Country
$Zip
Zip
$City
City
$State
State
$Address
Address
If these attributes are seen, they will be replaced with Mixpanel attributes:
mParticle attribute
will be changed to
created
$created
email
$email
lastSeen
$last_seen
name
$name
username
$username
With available user identity info and user attributes, standard people data being sent includes:
action type: $set for user identification
token: the application’s Mixpanel token
distinct_id: device’s UDID or user’s customerId
ip: the IP address of the request or “0”
time: the message timestamp
insert_id: used to de-duplicate events - this is set to mParticle event_id.
Data being sent in the $set section:
user attributes: following the rules in Attribute mappings
email address: if it exists in the user identities
Revenue Tracking and Commerce Events
In order to track revenue using mParticle and Mixpanel, you need to ensure that mParticle is forwarding on relevant data by enabling the Use Mixpanel People setting.
If the mParticle SDK method has been called to log an event, the event and one event attribute have been set up for LTV tracking, and the event is not excluded by an account policy, a transaction message will be sent to Mixpanel.
Mixpanel’s SDK Method
mParticle’s SDK Method
trackCharge
logEvent or logEcommerceTransactionWithProduct. Also, the logged events need to be set up as LTV tracking event in mParticle’s UI.
Only specific data will be considered as part of the transactional funnel. Standard message data format is:
action type: $transaction for a TrackCharge message
token: the application’s Mixpanel token
distinct_id: device’s UDID or user’s customerId
ip: the IP address of the request or “0”
time: the message timestamp
insert_id: used to de-duplicate events - this is set to mParticle event_id.
Data being sent in the transactions section:
$amount: the total value of the event
$time: the message timestamp in the format yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss
event attributes: follows the rules in Attribute Mappings
Web Attributes
Event batches sent to Mixpanel using the server-side web integration will also send the following data:
browser: the user’s web browser
browser version: the version of the web browser
os: the user’s operating system
Note that this data depends on the http_header_user_agent field so they will only be set if a value is included in the batch.
EU Data Localization
By default, mParticle sends data to Mixpanel’s US Servers, but offers an EU Data Localization option for their ingestion API, which allows data to be sent and stored in the Mixpanel EU Data Center (see Mixpanel’s documentation on Storing Your Data in the European Union). This EU Residency is not automatically set within a Mixpanel project. You can find steps on how to set EU Data Localization for your Mixpanel project within the Mixpanel documentation. In mParticle, the Mixpanel Target Server Configuration Setting must be set to EU Residency Server.
