OverviewmParticle allows you to define sophisticated, intelligent segments and deliver personalized experiences using both rules-based and predictive capabilities. Our machine learning engine analyzes user behavior patterns to help you identify and reach users most likely to take desired actions.
You can define audiences using any user-associated data captured with mParticle, whether from platform inputs or partner feeds, and enhance them with predictive insights.
When you fully instrument your app using the mParticle SDK, you send data from apps to the mParticle platform. This data feeds both traditional segmentation and our predictive models. You can also enrich that data stream with other sources like CRM data or purchase data from other channels. Comprehensive data capture improves both immediate segmentation and predictive accuracy.
If you need to send data via our Events API, please
contact our customer support team.
Examples
Use audiences to create sophisticated segments powered by both rules and machine learning.
Drive User Engagement Through Intelligent Segmentation
Let’s say you want to target users who installed your app to increase their engagement. There are two approaches to accomplishing this using Audiences:
Rules-based: Taking this strategy, you would use audience criteria to build a customer segment that aligns with your target characteristics, like users who installed your app in the last 72 hours with fewer than three sessions.
AI-powered: Using a predictive approach, you could simply define your business goal, then let Predictive Attributes to perform a comprehensive analysis of user data to predict which new users are most likely to take the engagement action you have defined. Once the Predictive Attribute has been generated, you could use it as an audience criteria to select users who are statistically most likely to engage with your app.
No matter which approach you take, you can easily forward your audience to push notification and email partners.
Once these audience connections are established, mParticle instantiates a corresponding audiences both partners.
No coding is necessary.
Drive app downloads
Let’s say you want to find more users like your currently highly engaged users and run an app download campaign in Facebook against that target audience. You start by defining your highly engaged users, using whatever criteria is important to you: lifetime value metrics, session activity, event activity, or any other data points you capture.
Once your audience is defined, configure the Facebook integration and corresponding custom audiences in your Facebook account.
From there you can leverage the custom audiences like any other custom audience in Facebook.
Because we want to target users that look like our highly engaged users, we will create a Facebook lookalike audience from our highly engaged user audience and run a Facebook app install campaign that targets that lookalike audience.Was this page helpful?YesNoLast Updated: February 27, 2025© 2025 mParticle, Inc.
