SettingsWhen you create a new project, don’t forget to review and configure your custom project settings. Project settings include time zone, date format, currency format, IP address collection, integrations, and project filters. Settings apply to all teammates, data, and saved analyses within the project.
Configure Your Project Settings
Owners and Admins have access to Project Settings, however Members and View Only teammates do not. Select the cog wheel icon on the left menu bar to review Project Settings.
Within Project Settings you’ll be able to access General Settings, Teammates, Data Sources, Scheduled Reports, and Data Filters.
General Settings
Time Zone
The time zone setting determines the display time zone for all events within the project. All new projects default to (GMT+00:00) UTC (00:00). Note, only one time zone may be selected per project.
You are able to set up queries to be in a time zone that is not in your project time zone: The time zone selector is located in the top right corner of the query builder within each tool.
Date Format
The date format setting determines the display style for dates in Analytics. Dates are commonly found along the x-axis of query results. There are three options for date format: US MM/DD/YYYY, European DD/MM/YYYY, or ISO YYYY-MM-DD. All new projects default to US MM/DD/YYYY.
Currency Format
The currency format setting allows you to change the currency and symbol displayed for all Revenue results in Analytics.
To use the Revenue event, you must complete a Revenue mapping in the Events and Properties settings. All new projects default to US Dollars $.
This setting is applied to Revenue results for reports within your entire Analytics project.

IP Address Collection
If your project is integrated using the Analytics SDK, then the IP Address Collection setting appears in your project settings. You may enable or disable the collection of IP address information for your project. All new projects default to enabled.
Note: IP geolocation tracking is restricted under the Child Protection Regulation (COPPA). Please ensure that you have disabled this within any project that contains data from online services directed toward children 13 years of age or younger. Analytics reserves the right to disable IP address collection if we suspect any violation, intentional or otherwise, of this regulation.
Public Sharing
Permit the sharing of embedded widgets, dashboard links, and scheduled reports externally.
AI Features
Enable or disable AI-assisted features including Assisted Analysis.
Teammates
View and modify all of the teammates in your organization. Users are listed with their name, role, status, and last login date.
Project Owners and Admins may change project member roles by clicking on the downward arrow within the role tab.
Data Sources
The Data Sources section displays a summary of the active and inactive data sources for your project, including the name, type, and date that event data was last seen (or received). A green dot indicates that the project received data from this data source recently. A red dot indicates that the project has not received data from this data source recently. A gray dot indicates that there is no information available about the status of this integration.
You are able to add a new data source to the project by clicking on New Data Source on the top right. This brings you to the Connect Your Data screen.
You may also view all data sources within an organization by accessing Data Sources within Organization settings. This will display data sources across all projects.
Data warehouse users may also view the specifics of their data warehouse integration by selecting Edit Details.
Scheduled Reports
Project Settings also contains a tool to manage Scheduled Reports. The table shows when reports were created and by which user, and the three-dot menu on the right allows editing of the underlying dashboard, as well as the features of the report itself. See our Reports documentation for more details.
Data Filters
If your project contains any data filters, then the data filters section displays the defining criteria for the filter(s). Data filters are applied to all queries within a project; they do not modify or otherwise change the underlying data in Analytics.Was this page helpful?YesNoLast Updated: February 27, 2025© 2025 mParticle, Inc.
