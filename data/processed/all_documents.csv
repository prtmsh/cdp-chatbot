It allows you to:
Review data sent into the Events API to ensure correct SDK and/or server-to-server implementation
Review outbound events to your connected integrations.
Test that your integrations are correctly set up. If there are any errors in forwarding event data to a specific integration, an error icon will appear next to the integration message type displaying the reason.
Filter Data
You can filter the data shown in the Live S",9,guides_data-master_live-stream_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/live-stream/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/live-stream/,"tream in several ways:
Inputs: Select an individual Platform or Feed to show only data from that input.
Outputs: Select an individual output event configuration in your workspace. If you set this filter, you must also set Message Direction to either Outbound or Both In and Out.
Message Direction: Select Inbound, Outbound, or Both In and Out. Inbound messages are data arriving in mParticle from instrumented apps or from partner feeds. Outbound messages are data sent by mParticle to an output service.
Device: Often, during testing, you will want to monitor a specific test device. The Device drop-down allows you to choose a device to monitor from all devices that are currently sending messages to all workspaces in the account, as well as all devices that have been saved.
Live Stream shows only development data, but if you filter for a specific device, the Live Stream will also show events from the Production environment. When attempting to match a device to a device ID, mParticle will loo",10,guides_data-master_live-stream_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/live-stream/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/live-stream/,"k for the following per platform:
iOS: IDFA (ios_advertising_id in the Events API)
Android: GAID (android_advertising_id)
Web and other platforms: Device Application Stamp (mp_deviceid)
To save a specific device:
Click Add/Edit Device to display the Device list.
Click + next to the device you want to add, or click Add New Device to display the Add Device form.
Enter/Modify the Device ID, Device Name, Device Type and click Add Device.
Click Save.
Once you save a device, it remains in the drop down list for all dashboard users.

You can use this technique in all regions and with all outputs.
Use the following process to load user attribute or event data from CSV files:
1. Create CSV files
File guidelines
Data guidelines
2. Get credentials for the mParticle SFTP server
3. Configure the Custom CSV Feed
4. Drop CSV files on the SFTP server
1. Create CSV files
Prepare the CSV files for ",9,guides_csv_import.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import,"import. Files must follow the guidelines in this section.
File guidelines
Files must adhere to the RFC4180 standards for CSV formatting.
Files must be sent in one of the following formats:
A plain CSV (.csv)
A ZIP file containing one or more CSV files (.zip)
A gzipped CSV (.csv.gz).
A PGP/GPG-encrypted file with the additional extension .gpg appended, for example, .csv.gpg or .csv.gz.gpg). Only encrypted OR unencrypted files can be accepted, but not both.
You must use PGP encryption with mParticle’s public key. See Encrypted files for additional instructions.
File sizes should be between 5 MB and 2 GB. If you upload files outside these limits, processing speed is slower. If possible, split the data across multiple small files, because their processing can be parallelized.
Each file can only contain events of the same event type. You can’t mix events of different types in the same file.
Don’t use subfolders.
Each row size should be under 80 KB. Larger rows may impact performance.
All co",10,guides_csv_import.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import,"lumn names must be unique.
Each CSV file must contain fewer than 50 columns.
File name requirements:
Do not use any dashes ( - ) or dots ( . ) in your file name, other than what is described below.
End the file name based on the event content in your file:
-custom_event.csv
-commerce_event.csv
-screen_view.csv
-eventless.csv for eventless uploads of user identities and attributes
Column names: specify fields according to our JSON Schema, using dot notation.
Column names described are case sensitive.
Data guidelines
Environment: include a column name environment set to development or production. If an environment column is not included, data is ingested into the production environment.
User and Device IDs: as with any data sent to mParticle, you must include a column with at least one user ID or device ID.
Device IDs
device_info.android_advertising_id
device_info.android_uuid
device_info.ios_advertising_id
device_info.att_authorization_status
device_info.ios_idfv
device_info.roku_advert",11,guides_csv_import.txt

User IDs

user_identities.microsoft
user_identities.twitter
user_identities.yahoo
user_identities.other
user_identities.other2
user_identities.other3
user_identities.other4
Important: CSV files must have all the required identity columns, and the rows must have valid values in those columns to prevent processing errors.
User attributes:
If you include user attributes, for each, include a column named as user_attributes.key, where key is a user attribute key. For example:
user_attributes.$FirstName
user_attributes.communication_preference
user_attributes.Member Tier
Attribute names with spaces are allowed and do not require quotes. All the keys listed in the JSON Reference are supported.
Events:
Use a column named events.data.timestamp_unixtime_ms to set the event time.
Use a column named
events.data.cus",12,guides_csv_import.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import,"tom_attributes.key, where key is an event attribute key, to set custom event attributes.
Attribute names with spaces are allowed and do not require quotes. All the keys listed in the JSON Reference are supported.
Screen view events: use a column named events.data.screen_name if you want to include the screen name.
Custom events: use columns named events.data.event_name and events.data.custom_event_type to include custom events.
Commerce events: use columns with the following names for commerce events.
events.data.product_action.action
events.data.product_action.products.id
events.data.product_action.products.name
events.data.product_action.products.category
events.data.product_action.products.brand
events.data.product_action.products.variant
events.data.product_action.products.position

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import,"a.product_action.products.total_product_amount
events.data.product_action.products.custom_attributes
Only one product per event can be included for commerce events uploaded via CSV.
Data types:
All data in the CSV is converted to a string. The only exceptions to this are values that require a particular data type, such as MPID or IDFA.
Only standard custom events and screen views, and eventless batches (eventless drops of user identity and attributes), have been tested.
Attributes sent as arrays are not fully supported. When the entire array is present in a single cell of the CSV file, it is supported and is converted to string. Because there is no way of specifying anything but the first item in an array, repeated header columns, each subsequent column overwrites the previous one. Multiple columns don’t append to the array. This is why you can only include one product for ecommerce events. Commerce events in the Events API support arrays in multiple places, but with CSV files, you can",14,guides_csv_import.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import," only populate a single item in each of these arrays.
Custom manifest: You can use a custom manifest to drop files created in another system without transforming them. For details, see Use a custom manifest.
2. Get credentials for the mParticle SFTP server
mParticle maintains an SFTP server where you will drop your CSV files.
Use the following instructions to securely retrieve your credentials and find the hostname and path to use when you drop your files on the SFTP server.
To get your SFTP username and password:
Sign up for a Keybase account with your work email at https://keybase.io/. Keybase is a secure tool which includes end-to-end encrypted chat.
Provide your Keybase account name to your Customer Success Manager or your mParticle Solutions Consultant so that they can pass it on to our Ops team.
Expect to receive your SFTP access credentials in a Keybase chat from mParticle. Note that if you need to use credentials that you already have, you’ll share those credentials in the Keyb",15,guides_csv_import.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import,"ase chat.
3. Configure the Custom CSV Feed
Configure the Custom CSV Feed as input. This step provides the hostname and folder path on the SFTP server where your CSV files must be dropped.
Subdirectories within this drop folder are not supported.
To maintain multiple directories, configure a different input for each directory.
To configure the Custom CSV Feed:
Visit SETUP > Inputs > Feeds in the mParticle UI and click the Add Feed Input button, then select Custom CSV Feed from the list.
If you’ve already added the Custom CSV Feed, it won’t show up in the list. Scroll through the list of feeds until you see Custom CSV Feed, and then click the large plus sign in the gray bar to create a new feed. You need one feed for each different event type.
Enter the following values:
Configuration Name: enter a name that makes this feed easy to recognize in your list of feeds.
Custom Event Name: if you are importing a custom event, enter the name that will be used for the custom event.
Custom Event T",16,guides_csv_import.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import,"ype: if you entered a custom event name, select the event type.
Custom Manifest: if you are using a custom manifest, paste it in the text box provided.
Expect Encrypted Files: if you will import a PGP/GPG-encrypted file, select this option.
After you complete the connection configuration, click Issue SFTP Details. mParticle displays your hostname and path for mParticle’s SFTP server.
4. Drop CSV files on the SFTP server
Connect to the mParticle SFTP server using the credentials provided. Once you have connected, the mParticle creates the drop folder. If you don’t see one, create a folder named drop.
Create a new folder inside the drop folder, and name it using the pathname provided in the mParticle UI as shown in the previous section. For example, based on the previous example, the folder path and name is sftp.mparticle.com:4422:drop/us1-123456789123456789/. Hint: Verify that there are no trailing spaces in the name.
Use your credentials to upload your CSV files to mParticle’s SFTP ser",17,guides_csv_import.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/import,"ver, using the correct path and folder name from the previous step.
Files on the SFTP location are added to the processing queue nearly immediately.
Depending on file count and file size, a backlog may develop. You can observe how much data has been processed using Data Master and your outbound connections. There is no notification of processing progress or completion.

Prerequisites
In order to enable the mParticle integration with Snapchat you will need the account credentials for a Snapchat account.
The integration activation process will prompt you to log into your Snapchat account, and once logged in, mParticle will automatically retrieve the credentials that it needs to forward audience data to Snapchat. If you intend to use the optional Value Based Audience feature, you will need to request Snap to enable the feature for your ad account and ensure they complete such request before you create a Value Based Audience connection in mParticle.
Activate Snapchat
Select Directory, and click the Snapchat tile.
Click Add Snapchat to Setup.
Select ",14,integrations_snapchat_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/snapchat/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/snapchat/audience,"the Output Audience Integration Type and click Add to Setup.
Select the Snapchat output configuration group and click Configure.
Click Login to Snapchat - A pop-up window will appear allowing you to enter your account credentials to access your Snapchat account.
Enter a Configuration Name.
Select your Account Credentials and click Save.
Click Accept to authorize mParticle to access your Snapchat account.
You can now connect your audiences to Snapchat.
Data Processing Notes
Minimum - An audience is selectable for targeting in Snapchat as long as it has a minimum of 1000 users.
Snapchat has a limit of 1000 custom audiences per ad account.
User Identity Mapping
When forwarding audience data to Snapchat, mParticle will send SHA-256 hash of the following identities based on the values of the Connection Settings:
Emails
Device IDs (IDFA or Google Advertising ID)
Phone Numbers (Mobile Telephone Number, Phone Number 2, Phone Number 3, and $mobile reserved user attribute)
When enabling Phone Nu",15,integrations_snapchat_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/snapchat/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/snapchat/audience,"mbers, please make sure to include country code in phone numbers since it's required by Snap. Ex: +1 800-555-1111.
Upload Frequency
The Snapchat Audience Integration uses Bulk Forwarding. Bulk Forwarding means that, instead of uploading updates to an audience in real time, mParticle compiles updates into a queue until either a given amount of time has passed since the last upload, or until a certain number of updates are waiting to be sent.
By default, mParticle uploads to Snapchat whenever at least one of the following conditions is met:
3 hours have passed since the last update.
At least 500000 messages are in the queue.
Upload frequency can sometimes be adjusted. Reach out to your mParticle Customer Success Manager if you need to discuss upload frequency.
Deleting an Audience
When you delete a connection or audience, the downstream segment in Snap will be deleted.
Value-based audiences
You can use the mParticle audience integration to create value-based audiences with Snap. As a pre",16,integrations_snapchat_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/snapchat/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/snapchat/audience,"requisite, Snap must enable value-based audience support for your ad account.
By default, mParticle will forward all users in a value-based audience to Snap even if their user attribute representing value is missing or negative. You can exclude users with negative, missing, and zero values by unchecking the Allow Zero And Negative Values connection setting when creating your value-based audience.
Value-based audiences can only be created during the process of first connecting an mParticle audience with Snapchat. Audiences that have already been connected to Snapchat can’t be turned into value-based audiences.

Our goal is to help you develop a complete view of your users, across all of your data sources, and make that view available wherever it is needed. The user profile is central to this goal.
An mParticle user profile represents a complete picture of what you’ve learned about a given user over time, across all of your channels, continuously updated and maintained in real time as you capture new data",9,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,".
Within mParticle, user profiles serve four core functions:
Enrich event data with information about the user, before it is forwarded to downstream systems
Calculate Audience memberships and Calculated Attributes
Display information about a user in the User Activity View
Offer personalized experiences at any touchpoint via the Profile API
How Profiles Are Used
Use profiles in mParticle to understand users and create personalized experiences:
Inspect the profile of any user in the mParticle UI.
Enrich a profile with complete and up-to-date information about the user it represents.
Deliver profiles in JSON format with the Profile API to create personalized experiences based on user attributes or audience memberships.
Drive real-time calculations and Customer segmentations.
User Activity View
Inspect the profile for any user in the mParticle UI via the User Activity View. To find user profiles, you can search by any user identity type you capture, or by the mParticle ID. You can also nav",10,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,"igate to the User Activity View for active users in your development environment by inspecting a batch in the Live Stream.
For more information, see User Activity.
Profile Enrichment
Profile enrichment allows mParticle to make sure that each of your downstream systems has the most complete and up-to-date information about each of your users. For example, mParticle receives data as batches from native SDKs, our HTTP API and third-party data feeds. Each batch is a JSON object containing an array of events and contextual information about the user, such as identities, user attributes, and device information. mParticle processes the information in each batch and forwards it to downstream systems through event integrations. Before a batch from a particular source is forwarded, mParticle compares it to the matching user profile and adds additional information.
If you collect the same user attribute from multiple sources, for example an iOS app and a web app, mParticle accepts the most recent",11,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/," version. For example, if Bob sets his favorite drink to “Beer” in the web app, and then changes it to “Coke” in the iOS app the next day, Bob’s user profile will use the most recent value for enrichment.
Enrichment ensures that all of your downstream tools can receive complete and accurate information about your users. Remember that you can still use data filters to prevent downstream systems from receiving user attributes that they don’t need.
Profile API
The mParticle user profile can be delivered in JSON format by the Profile API, in order to deliver personalized experiences based on user attributes or audience memberships. To request a profile from the API, supply either the corresponding MPID or a specially configured immutable ID (usually the Customer ID).
For more information, see Profile API.
Audiences and Calculated Attributes
Audiences allow you to define segments of users based on rule based criteria of their event behavior and profile data. mParticle builds and maintains t",12,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,"hese segments of users over time which can then be connected to hundreds of outputs for activation.
Audiences and Calculated attributes are built from all your profile data, including calculated attributes, and events that have been collected across all your data sources. For real-time audiences, these are within the audience look back window. Standard audiences utilize your extended Data Retention policy. For more information about data retention, see Data Retention.
For more information, see Audiences and Calculated Attributes.
Understanding Profile Data
Two main classes of data provide context about your users and the events they trigger.
User data
User data describes the attributes of individual user profiles. It includes information such as what identities they have, device types and IDs, and a number of custom attributes such as membership status and demographic information. An attribute can reflect either current or previous values, depending on its nature and how often it is up",13,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,"dated. User data is stored in profiles.
Event data
Event data describes actions that your users take. They contain information current for the moment at which the event was triggered. For example, the event “Sign up” could have an event attribute of “membership tier”, which denotes the membership status at time of signing up. Event data is stored in events.
Profile Schema
Each profile describes useful details about the user associated with the profile.
A user profile contains the following elements:
mParticle ID - a unique identifier for the user within mParticle
The IDSync API resolves identities like email, customer ID and device IDs to a single mParticle ID.
Each mParticle ID maps to a single user profile.
First-seen timestamp
User responses to Limit Ad Tracking (iOS) and global opt-out
All known identities for the user
All Audience memberships for the user
The most recently seen IP address associated with the user
The IP address is always updated with the most recent value based on",14,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/," the X-Forwarded-For header for client SDK batches or the ip field for batches ingested from server-to-server connections. The IP address on a user profile is only forwarded to connected outputs if the Enrich IP Address setting is available and enabled for the connection.
For each workspace the user has been seen in:
All user attributes captured in the workspace, including Calculated Attributes
Any consent information captured for the user
For each device the user has been seen on:
Device Application Stamp - a unique identifier for a device within a workspace
Device information, including device identities
First-seen timestamp
Apple App Transparency Tracking status
Install attribution information
More about the mParticle schema can be found here.
How a Profile Is Updated
Most of the time, mParticle automatically keeps user profiles updated as you capture new data with any of the following methods:
The setUserAttribute SDK method
Sending a “batch” of user and event data to the HTTP API
",15,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,"Sending user data from a third-party feed
However, sometimes it is necessary to make direct updates to your user profiles in bulk. This happens most often when you’re loading large amounts of data from legacy systems.
To directly update a profile, you can make a standard request to our HTTP API, and leave out the events node. For example:
{
""user_identities"" : {
""email"": ""john.smith@example.com"",
""customerid"": ""JohnSmith911""
},
""user_attributes"" : {
""skill_level"": 9,
},
""deleted_user_attributes"" : [
""color_preference""
],
""environment"": ""production""
}
User attributes updated in this way will not be immediately updated in all downstream event integrations. Most event integrations in mParticle will not process a batch with no events. However, as long as you are sending some event data to each integration, the enrichment process will make sure that user attributes are updated the next time an event is sent for each user.
If it is important for profile updates to be reflected across all you",16,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,"r systems immediately, add an event to the batch. For example:
{
""events"": [
{
""data"": {
""event_name"": ""Attributes Updated"",
""custom_event_type"": ""other""
},
""event_type"": ""custom_event""
}
],
""user_identities"" : {
""email"": ""john.smith@example.com"",
""customerid"": ""JohnSmith911""
},
""user_attributes"" : {
""skill_level"": 9,
},
""deleted_user_attributes"" : [
""color_preference""
],
""environment"": ""production""
}
User attributes and input source priority
For a given user, attributes are stored at the workspace level, not the device level.
User attributes are ingested according to the following priority:
Calculated attributes
Account-level attributes (a premium feature)
Custom feed input
SDK input
Custom CSV and Warehouse Sync
Partner data feed (PDF)
While partner data feeds are considered unique, once a user attribute is set from one partner data feed, it can still be overwritten by another feed. For example, if the Punchh integration sets the $FirstName for a profile, but a different first name i",17,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,"s later ingested from AppsFlyer, then the profile’s $FirstName will be set to the value ingested from AppsFlyer.
Once ingested from one input source, subsequent, lower-prioity source types for that same data won't be ingested. For example, once you set a user attribute key value using the Web SDK, you won't be able to set that same key value from a Custom CSV or partner data feed. However, data from input sources of the same priority will be ingested.
Input protections
You can override the default behavior for input feeds, and specify whether data ingested from a feed creates new profiles or updates existing profiles. Choose from one of three input protection levels:
Create & Update - Allows the input to both create new profiles and update existing profiles. All inputs default to this setting.
Update Only - Prevents input from creating new profiles, but allows the input to update existing profiles.
Read Only - Prevents the input from creating or updating profiles.
The default profile p",18,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,"rotection level for all input feeds is Create & Update.
Profile protection levels are specific to each input configuration, providing more granular control over multiple configurations even if they are contained in a single workspace.
When ingesting user data from an input, mParticle searches for an existing profile that corresponds with any of the user identifiers included with the data. The identity strategy configured for your account determines if a new profile is created when an existing profile can’t be found.
You can prevent unwanted changes by defining one or more input protections.
Input protections are only available for data feeds, and are not currently supported for platform inputs like Web, Android, or iOS.
Configure the profile protection level for an input
To set the protection level for an existing input:
Log into your mParticle account and navigate to Setup > Inputs in the left nav bar.
Click the Feeds tab and expand the list of configurations for your input.
Select th",19,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,"e configuration you want to change the protection level for.
Use the Input Protection Level dropdown menu to change the protection level for the input.
When creating a new input feed, you are given the input protection dropdown menu, allowing you to set the protection level for that input from the start.
Only mParticle users with Admin permissions can modify an input's protection level.
Create & Update Profiles
This setting removes all restrictions from an input’s access to a user profile, meaning that new user profiles can be created and modified as data is ingested.
For example, if mParticle receives data from the input that it can’t associate with an existing profile and your account uses the default identity strategy, then it creates a new profile for the user. If a matching profile was found, the data from the input enriches the found profile.
Only Update Profiles
This setting ensures that only data from known, existing users in the workspace is ingested. If IDSync can’t find a ma",20,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,"tching profile (in other words, if the user is unknown) then the data is discarded. Only existing users within the workspace can be updated, and all other unknown users are ignored.
For example, if mParticle receives data from the input that it can’t associate with an existing profile and your account uses the default identity strategy, mParticle will not create a new profile for the user and the data will not be associated with an MPID. However, if a matching profile was found, then the user data from the input enriches the found profile.
If an event batch includes user data with an MPID or user identifiers that don’t resolve to an existing MPID in your mParticle workspace, mParticle will drop the data and it will not be forwarded to any outputs. However, this is still a billable event due to the processing needed when searching for a matching MPID in your workspace.
Example use case: ingesting data from multiple brands
Imagine you have a business with a large customer base, but multi",21,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,"ple storefronts or customer touch-points. These various touch-points are housed under separate brands and any one customer engages with many of them.
Furthermore, you have chosen to use a centralized data warehouse to help keep your customer data consolidated.
However, you want to ingest customer data into mParticle from your warehouse while maintaining a single user profile for each customer. To do this, you must prevent new profiles from being created. This is where the Only Update protection level is useful.
By setting your data warehouse input feed to Only Update, mParticle ensures that as new data for a known customer is ingested, that data is attributed to a single user profile. Without this protection, it would be possible for a separate user profile to be created for each of your brands a customer engages with. This would prevent you from maintaining a holistic perspective of your customers’ history.
Only Read Profiles
Prevents all write access to profiles and IDSync. Event bat",22,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,"ches are ingested normally, but existing profiles can’t be modified and new profiles can’t be added to protect user profiles and IDsync records from undesired modifications from the input.
For example, if mParticle receives data from the input that it can’t associate with an existing profile and your account uses the default identity strategy, then it will not create a new profile for the user and the data will not be associated with an MPID. If a matching profile was found, mParticle will not associate the data with the found profile.
If an event batch includes user data with an MPID or user identifiers that don’t resolve to an existing MPID in your mParticle workspace, mParticle ingests and forwards the event batch to other outputs, but it will not create a new profile for the MPID.
Example use case: testing new input configurations
Keeping your customer data clean and uncontaminated is critical. However, it’s also essential to be able to test new connections from your data warehouse",23,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,"s to mParticle.
To configure and test a new input feed from a warehouse without allowing any ingested data to modify your existing customer profiles, you can set the initial protection level for the new feed to Only Read. This allows you to verify that data is ingested properly, without any of that data leading to the modification or creating of new user profiles.
After you’re confident in your new input configuration, you can change the protection level to allow data from that input to begin enriching profiles.
Data retention and profiles
Profiles are available for different periods of time, depending on the data retention policy for your account.

Setting Up the Solution in mParticle
In mParticle, create an audience with the criteria for all users who haven’t had their user profile enriched in the last n days.
Connect the audience to the enrichment module. mParticle will then send emails that need a raw UID value. The enrichment service talks to either a private or public UID instance to retrieve the token.
Once the UID value is o",25,guides_personalization_profiles_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/,"btained, it will send a custom event to mParticle via custom feed input, adding the UID value as a partner ID.

Listen for SDK Initialization
The web SDK loads asynchronously and is therefore not immediately available for use. However, this snippet creates stubbed versions of several mParticle APIs such that your function invocations are queued until the SDK loads. The following APIs are stubbed for you and will be placed on a function queue when invoked after the snippet but prior to when the SDK loads:
logEvent()
logPageView()
See the latest prettified snippet on Github for a complete list
You may also add any function to a generic queue via the mParticle.ready() helper method and it will be ",12,developers_client-sdks_web_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/,"invoked once the SDK loads:
window.mParticle.ready(
function() {
console.log('mParticle has loaded!');
// !! Note: do not attempt to access the user object at this point
// !! var user = window.mParticle.Identity.getCurrentUser();
// !! Instead, access the user object via the mParticle.config.identityCallback option
}
);
Initial identification request
The web SDK does the following on every page load:
Detects if there is an active session in the current or any other browser tab
If an active session is not found, the SDK constructs an IDSync request containing the most recent user identities from the previous browser session. You can manually specify the IDSync request via the identifyRequest property of your mParticle.config object.
If an active session is found, then no IDSync HTTP request is performed
Regardless of whether an IDSync HTTP request is performed, the SDK will invoke the IDSync callback function described below.
A common use-case is to access the mParticle user object imm",13,developers_client-sdks_web_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/,"ediately on page load. The best way to do this is to specify a function as the identityCallback property of your mParticle.config object:
window.mParticle = {
config: {
identifyRequest: {
userIdentities: {
email:
'email@example.com',
customerid: '123456'
}
},
identityCallback: function(result) {
//This is the quickest way to acquire a reference to the user object
//this callback is invoked on every page load
if (result.getUser()) {
result.getUser().setUserAttribute('foo', 'bar');
}
}
}
};
See the IDSync documentation for more information on building a complete IDSync request.
Device Id (Device Application Stamp)
When the Web SDK initializes, mParticle generates a random UUIDv4-formatted string to be the browser’s device id (Device Application Stamp, or das).
mParticle allows developers to retrieve this by calling mParticle.getDeviceId().
The device ID is unique to each browser’s persistence layer. This means that a new device ID is generated for each browser, so if a user uses multiple",14,developers_client-sdks_web_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/," browsers, then their MPID will have multiple device IDs associated with it.
Additionally, if a user clears cookies/local storage, or uses a browser’s private browsing mode (ie. incognito mode), a new instance of persistence is created, resulting in another device ID.
Furthermore, if multiple people use the same computer and browser (ie. families, public computers), then a single device ID will be associated with multiple users.
mParticle allows an advanced use case for our customers to set the device ID via two different methods:
During initialization - set window.mParticle.config.deviceId.
Mid session - call mParticle.setDeviceId('UUIDv2-formatted-string').
Note that an invalid device ID will result in data not reaching our servers, so we recommend doing lots of manual testing if configuring the device ID.
One use case is passing the device ID between an iFrame and parent page when mParticle is on both pages. In this case, you should call getDeviceId from one level (for example the i",15,developers_client-sdks_web_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/,"Frame) and send that value to the other (for example the parent page).Was this page helpful?YesNoLast Updated: February 27, 2025© 2025 mParticle, Inc.

The Events tab will show a timeline of historical event data from the user, up until the previous day. Events can be filtered by Date, Input, Event Type and Device. In addition to filtering, you can also choose to highlight selected event names in the timeline.
The Last Updated tag in the UAV Events view indicates the last time the data was refreshed on the page, not when the previous day's data has been loaded.
The timezone for this tag is UTC.
Events are grouped in batches, with the input source in bold. Click a batch heading to view common attributes for the batch, or an event name to view attributes for the event. eCommerce events show details for the transaction and also for each product, including quantity and total price per product.
Event data received with an event timestamp that is 72 hours older than the time it is received will not be captured in this report. For example: Today is February 24, 2022 at 11:00 UTC, I send an event to the API with event timestamp Februar",15,guides_platform-guide_activity__user-activity.txt

Click the Link button in the details view to copy a sharable direct link to the event to your clipboard.
As with the Live Stream You can expand any event or batch to view the raw JSON data.
Edit a user profile
The User Activity View allows you to manually edit certain properties of individual user profiles. This can be useful if you need to correct profile data and you want the updated profile data to be immediately forwarded to your downstream connections.
Whenever you modify user profile data, you must select one of your configured inputs. This allows mParticle to route your changes through that input, updating the user profile, before finally forwarding the changes to any active, connected outputs.

Event Forwarding
The Event Forwarding report provides information on your app’s incoming event data and the data that is forwarded to enabled output event services. This is where you can verify how much data mParticle captured per event, and how much data was forwarded.
If multiple configurations are enabled for an integration, the data sent to each configuration will be shown separately. We recommend checking this report if you notice any discrepancies in your vendor dashboards.
Event data received with an event timestamp that is 72 hours older than the time it is received will not be captured in this report. For example: Today is February 24, 2022 at 11:00 UTC, I send an event to the API with event timestamp February 21, 2022 at 10:00 UTC. The report for February 21, 2022 view will not count the event. Please work with mParticle Support to pull a report of total event counts if sen",30,guides_platform-guide_activity__user-activity.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/#user-activity,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/#user-activity,"ding backdated data.
The report displays a daily summary of events, plus counts for each message type and event name, along with the inbound and outbound counts for each enabled service.
By default a summary of data for a full day is shown, but you can also select a specific hour to display hourly data.
You may notice differences between an inbound data count and an outbound data count. There are several reasons these differences may occur. Here are some good questions to start with:
Did you enable/disable the service on the date in question?
Are you using data filters?
Is the message type not supported by the integration?
Have you chosen configuration or connection settings that exclude certain message types?
Are you sending commerce events that are expanded before being forwarded?
Commerce Event Types and Event Forwarding
Four events, called commerce events, capture information about financial transactions: product commerce events, purchase or refund commerce events, promotion commer",31,guides_platform-guide_activity__user-activity.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/#user-activity,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/#user-activity,"ce events, and impression commerce events.
Commerce events behave differently from other events:
If the event is forwarded using an mParticle SDK with an embedded kit that doesn’t implement logCommerceEvent, then the event is expanded to ensure that no data is lost.
If the event is forwarded server-to-server or using an mParticle SDK with an embedded kit that does support logCommerceEvent, then no expansion is needed, and no data is lost.
In addition, the expansion behavior is different depending on the commerce event type:
Product commerce events and impression commerce events expand to one event per product.
Purchase or refund commerce events add an additional event with the total value.
Promotion commerce events expand to one event per promotion action type such as “click” or “view.”

However, you probably don’t want all of your data going to every output service you use. For this reason, mParticle provides the Data Filter as a simple way to control the flow of data to your outputs.
The Data Filter displays a complete list of all data points (a data point can be an event, an attribute of a user or event, or a user identifier) collected in your workspace, and allows you to di",9,guides_platform-guide_data-filter_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/data-filter/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/data-filter/,"sable forwarding of any individual data point to any of your output services.
The following video explains data filtering in mParticle:
Find Your Data Points
The first time you visit the Data Filter, you will see an empty grid. To start filtering you need to:
Choose your input source. You can filter data from ‘Platforms’ (iOS, Android, Web, etc.) or from incoming Feeds. Note that data for all your platforms will be included on one page in the Data Filter, so if you have used different event names or data types for different platforms, make sure you account for all of them.
Add outputs. You can add an output to each column by clicking the +, or select and sort your outputs in the Choose Integrations dialog by clicking the button above, and to the right of, the grid.
Choose a Data Type. Depending on the data available in your workspace, you can select from up to four data tabs: Events, Users, Screens and E-Commerce.
Disable Data Points
You can filter event data at 3 levels: Event Type, E",10,guides_platform-guide_data-filter_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/data-filter/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/data-filter/,"vent Name and Event Attributes.
Disabling an event type will disable forwarding for all events and attributes of that type.
Disabling an event name will disable forwarding for all that event’s attributes.
It's important to remember that the Data Point Filter is independent from the mParticle forwarders that handle transforming and forwarding your data to each output service. It includes switches for every data point, even if that data point is never forwarded to a particular output service. For example, Amplitude only accepts Customer ID and Email Address as User IDs. Leaving the filter switches on for other ID types will have no effect.
Always check the documentation for each integration for details on what data is forwarded.
New Data Points
The Filter allows you to disable any current data point from being forwarded to any current output service. However, as you continue to use mParticle, update your app instrumentation, and add inputs, you will continue to generate new data points. ",11,guides_platform-guide_data-filter_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/data-filter/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/data-filter/,"One of the most important decisions to make in the Filter is how to handle new data points for each output service. By default, mParticle will automatically forward new data points to each output service. If you uncheck the Send new data points by default box, no new data points will be forwarded to that output until you explicitly enable it in the Filter.
New data points will be added to the Data Filter the first time mParticle receives them. It should only take a few minutes from mParticle receiving a data point for it to be visible in the Data Filter.
Shortcuts
A mature mParticle project may have hundreds of events. That’s a lot of filter switches. To save you time, we provide some convenience methods to help you set your filters quickly. To access the shortcuts for an output service, click the elipsis near the top of the column.
From this menu you can:

There are critical changes coming to mParticle and the Apple SDK for iOS 14.5 and the App Tracking Transparency framework. For more information, navigate to the dedicated guide for iOS 14 and App Tracking Transparency.
Add SDK Dependencies
mParticle’s iOS SDK is powered by a “core” library, which supports mParticle’s server-side integrations and audience platform. Please follow the releases page on Github to stay up to date with the latest versio",9,developers_client-sdks_ios_initialization_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/ios/initialization/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/ios/initialization/,"n.
You can add the SDK via CocoaPods, Carthage, or by building manually from source.
CocoaPods
To integrate the SDK using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:
target '<Your Target>' do
pod 'mParticle-Apple-SDK', '~> 8'
end
Carthage
To integrate the SDK using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:
github ""mparticle/mparticle-apple-sdk"" ~> 8.0
Manual
You can also manually include the latest binary distribution or build the SDK from source.
See the Github releases page for the latest Carthage binaries, which you can manually drag/drop into in your Xcode project.
See the Github wiki for how to manually build the SDK from source.
Initialize the SDK
You can initialize the SDK with an MParticleOptions object. At minimum you must supply your mParticle workspace key and secret.
Supply your MParticleOptions object to the mParticle start API to initialize the SDK:
The SDK is designed to be initialized within the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method. The SDK performs very little wor",10,developers_client-sdks_ios_initialization_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/ios/initialization/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/ios/initialization/,"k before delegating all actions to a background queue. Also, please do not use Grand Central Dispatch’s dispatch_async API to start the SDK. If the SDK is initialized later in the UIApplication lifecycle, session and installation events may not be recorded correctly.
Objective-CSwift
// Assumes the SDK has been included as a dynamic library
// Requires ""Enable Modules (C and Objective-C)"" in pbxproj
@import mParticle_Apple_SDK;
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
//initialize mParticle
MParticleOptions *options = [MParticleOptions optionsWithKey:@""REPLACE WITH APP KEY""
secret:@""REPLACE WITH APP SECRET""];
[[MParticle sharedInstance] startWithOptions:options];
return YES;
}
import mParticle_Apple_SDK
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
//initialize mParticle
let options = MParticleOptions(key: ""REPLACE WITH APP",11,developers_client-sdks_ios_initialization_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/ios/initialization/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/ios/initialization/," KEY"",
secret: ""REPLACE WITH APP SECRET"")
MParticle.sharedInstance().start(with: options)
return true
}
Initial identification request
The SDK will automatically initialize with the most recent user identities from the most recently active user. You may override this by including an identity request via the identify API of your MParticleOptions object:
Objective-CSwift
MParticleOptions *options = [MParticleOptions optionsWithKey:@""REPLACE WITH APP KEY""
secret:@""REPLACE WITH APP SECRET""];
options.identifyRequest = identityRequest;
[[MParticle sharedInstance] startWithOptions:options];
let options = MParticleOptions(key: ""REPLACE WITH APP KEY"",
secret: ""REPLACE WITH APP SECRET"")
options.identifyRequest = identityRequest
MParticle.sharedInstance().start(with: options)
See the IDSync documentation for more information on building a complete identity request.
Kit Integrations
Several integrations require additional client-side add-on libraries called “kits.” Some kits embed other SDKs, othe",12,developers_client-sdks_ios_initialization_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/ios/initialization/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/ios/initialization/,"rs just contain a bit of additional functionality. Kits are designed to feel just like server-side integrations; you enable, disable, filter, sample, and otherwise tweak kits completely from the mParticle platform UI. Reference the kit documentation for information on kits.Was this page helpful?YesNoLast Updated: February 27, 2025© 2025 mParticle, Inc.

It's important to remember the difference between Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) and Identifier for Vendors (IDFV). An IDFA is a unique ID created by Apple that is assigned to one device that allows users to opt in and out of tracking. An IDFV is a unique ID created by Apple that is assigned to all apps created by a single developer.

partner_identities
Partner Identities are unique identifiers associated with a user, but specific to a partner system. They can be ingested by mParticle via Partner Feed or our S2S API, and can be sent to downstream connections associated with the given partner. A Partner Feed can only send in their registered partner identity, whereas a S2S request can include any partner identity.
{
""partner_identities"": {
""partner_id"": ""1234""
}
}
The incoming request can fail if:
A Partner Feed sends in a partner identity that is not associated with the partner.
An unregistered partner identity is sent.
Registering a new Partner Identity
Before a partner’s unique identity can be ingested, it must be registered with mParticle. Partners can register a new identity by either:
Contacting mParticle.
Updating your Firehose module, if applicable. For more information, see Firehose — Partner I",46,developers_apis_json-reference_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/apis/json-reference/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/apis/json-reference/,"dentities.
The naming convention for these identities is as follows: PartnerName_IdentityName.
An example for mParticle could be: mParticle_mpid
integration_attributes
Integration attributes are unique values associated with a given user, for a given integration. They are generally required for the integration to function properly.
The JSON blob is indexed by Module ID, meaning each integration can have its own values:
{
""integration_attributes"": {
""123"": {
""someIntegrationAttribute"": ""value""
}
}
}
In order to find out a given integration’s ID, you can check the corresponding URL from the mParticle Directory.
consent_state
Used to communicate the GDPR consent state for the user. For GDPR, you must define the purposes (shown here as location_collection and parental) in the mParticle UI. For CCPA, only the below purpose is allowed and it does not need to be defined. Pass consented: true to register a users opt-out to CCPA data sale.

Differences between incoming and outgoing JSON
Described above is the format required for sending data to mParticle via the Events API. A very similar format is used to send data to event outputs that accept raw JSON, including:
Amazon Kinesis
Amazon Kinesis Firehose
Amazon S3
Amazon SNS
Amazon SQS
Apache Kafka
Google Cloud Storage
Google Pub/Sub
Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
Microsoft Azure Event Hub
Slack
Webhooks
For these forwarders, mParticle makes our output as complete as possible, including fields only used internally or fields that are set automatically by mParticle and not part of the inbound JSON reference. The most important difference between incoming and outgoing JSON is that the user_id",54,developers_apis_json-reference_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/apis/json-reference/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/apis/json-reference/,"entities field is expanded in the outgoing JSON to include additional information. In most other cases, additional fields added in the outgoing JSON are intended for internal use or to support edge cases and should be ignored unless you have a special need for these fields.
Some notable differences include:
mParticle may add identifiers for the batch (batch_id), and each event (message_id). These are used by mParticle for internal processing tasks like de-duping.
mParticle adds a message_type field to each event, which is used for internal processing.
mParticle may add session management fields to each event: session_id, session_uuid and session_start_unixtime.
Outbound JSON will include an event_start_unixtime_ms field. In almost all cases this will be the same as the main event timestamp_unixtime_ms field. It exists to support timed event use cases.
mParticle adds a top-level batch timestamp — timestamp_unixtime_ms — representing the time the batch was received by mParticle. This fie",55,developers_apis_json-reference_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/apis/json-reference/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/apis/json-reference/,"ld is created by mParticle and should not be set manually when sending data via the Events API.
Some fields are set automatically by one or more native SDKs. For example, the Android SDK automatically sets an activity_type of activity_started or activity_stopped on Screen View events. This field is used by some event integrations to determine how to forward the event.
The system_notifications field is currently used by mParticle to forward changes in consent state to some partners. In outbound JSON this field is present but empty unless you are instrumenting data privacy controls.
mParticle may add a top-level batch unique_id field if you enter a value for the Unique ID connection setting.
Outgoing User Identities
In outgoing JSON, the user_identities node is an array of identity objects. Each object contains the identity type, the value, and a timestamp showing when the identity was last updated. For example:
{
""user_identities"": [
{
""identity_type"": ""customer_id"",
""identity"": ""h.jeky",56,developers_apis_json-reference_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/apis/json-reference/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/apis/json-reference/,"ll.md"",
""timestamp_unixtime_ms"": 1540483995196
},
{
""identity_type"": ""email"",
""identity"": ""h.jekyll.md@example.com"",
""timestamp_unixtime_ms"": 1540483995196
}
]
}
JSON Schema Validation
mParticle’s server-side SDKs are designed to generate correct JSON in all cases. If you are unable to use mParticle’s SDKs, you can use the mParticle Events API JSON schema documents to validate your JSON prior to upload.
Inbound Events API Schema
Inbound Events Bulk API Schema
Python
The following example uses the popular jsonschema library and performs the following:
Downloads the latest Event API schemas (both the single and bulk variations)
Creates an arbitrary example upload as a dictionary
Validates both the single and bulk instance objects
from jsonschema import validate, exceptions
import urllib.request, json
schema_url = ""https://docs.mparticle.com/schema/mparticle.inbound.eventsapi.schema.json""

bulk_url = urllib.request.urlopen(bulk_schema_url)
bulk_schema = json.loads(bulk_url.read().decode())

mParticle supports Braze Web SDK v5 as of 10/30/2024
You can opt in to V5 of the Braze SDK by selecting the version in a connection setting in the mParticle UI.
For more details about upgrading to V5 of the Braze web SDK, follow these instructions, whether you self-host or load mParticle via snippet/CDN..
If you are using version 2 of the @mparticle/web-appboy-kit, you will need to transition to @mparticle/web-braze-kit per the instructions here before following the above instructions as well.
Braze is a comprehensive customer engagement platform that powers relevant experiences between consumers and brands they love. Braze helps brands foster human connection through interactive conversations across channels.
Braze offers a broad range of functionality via their solution and it is critically important that you work directly with your Braze representative to ensure that you are correctly planning and impl",14,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"ementing their features.
mParticle does not recommend enabling forwarding to Braze until you have completed the Braze planning process with your Braze team.
Braze Documentation
mParticle Braze Implementation Scenarios
The mParticle SDK allows you to include the Braze kit which allows Braze interface components (images, layout files, etc.) and as a result supports many Braze features, including:
App Analytics
User Segmentation
Push Notifications
Email
News Feed
In-App Messaging
Feedback
Geolocation
Features are supported by the mParticle SDK only after you install the mParticle Braze Kit (formerly Appboy), which then forwards data from your app to Braze.
Features are supported in two ways:
The kit itself provides functionality directly without you having to call the third-party SDK. For example, most partners have a method called or equivalent to logEvent.
When someone calls mParticle.logEvent, our kits map to the partner SDK logEvent method, in this case, Braze.logEvent, and automatica",15,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"lly sends it to Braze. You don’t have to call Braze.logEvent because mParticle does it for you after you call mParticle.logEvent.
For some features, for example some Braze banners or modals, you must call Braze.bannerMethod() or Braze.modalMethod(). Our kit loads Braze so that you can call any Braze method you need, even if our kit does not call it for you.
The mParticle S2S API allows you to send data server side (API reference). The S2S API supports iOS, Android and Web data. In this scenario, mParticle forwards data via Braze’s REST API which supports a limited set of features.
For server-side data to be forwarded to Braze, it must include your selected External Identity Type. To relax this requirement, see the Disable External ID Constraint connection setting.
The following event types can be forwarded to Braze via S2S:
Commerce Event
Custom Event
Opt Out
Push Message
Push Message Registration
Screen View
Session Start / End
Kit Integration
The Braze solution offers features that i",16,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"nvolve Braze-proprietary user interaction components including Newsfeed, In-App Messaging, and Feedback.
To use Braze with one of the mParticle mobile SDKs, please review the kit documentation for the Android SDK or the iOS SDK.
You must directly call the Braze kit to use the Newsfeed, In-App Messaging, and Feedback features. Examples of directly calling a kit are provided for both Android and iOS.
Braze v9 iOS SDK Upgrade Notes
To comply with Apple’s iOS 17 privacy manifest it is required to update to Braze SDK version 9.0.0 or later which is included by the mParticle Braze Kit version 8.60 or later. Note that it is also required to update to at least version 8.24.0 of the mParticle SDK if you are not creating your own Braze instance and passing it to the mParticle Braze Kit in order for this functionality to work.
There are also additional steps required to comply which are outlined in the Braze documentation here.
If you are creating your own Braze instance and passing it to the mPa",17,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"rticle Kit as described in the iOS App Launch Tracking section below, you can simply follow instructions in the above Braze documentation directly.
If not, you will still need to follow the above Braze documentation, with the following exceptions:
Set the trackingPropertyAllowList property on the mParticle Braze Kit before starting the mParticle SDK instead of setting it on the Braze instance directly.
SwiftObjective-C
// In this example, we're setting phone number and email as tracking data.
// Replace the values in the allow list with the data you are tracking
MPKitAppboy.setBrazeTrackingPropertyAllowList([.email, .dateOfBirth])
// In this example, we're setting phone number and email as tracking data.
// Replace the values in the allow list with the data you are tracking
NSSet *allowList = [NSSet setWithArray:@[BRZTrackingProperty.phoneNumber, BRZTrackingProperty.email]];
[MPKitAppboy setBrazeTrackingPropertyAllowList:allowList];
In your ATTrackingManager request callback, call the ",18,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"corresponding method on the mParticle SDK instead of setting it on the Braze instance directly.
SwiftObjective-C
ATTrackingManager.requestTrackingAuthorization { status in
let mpStatus = MPATTAuthorizationStatus(rawValue: status.rawValue) ?? .notDetermined
let timestampMillis: NSNumber = (Date().timeIntervalSince1970 * 1000) as NSNumber
MParticle.sharedInstance().setATTStatus(mpStatus, withATTStatusTimestampMillis: timestampMillis)
}
[ATTrackingManager requestTrackingAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler:^(ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatus status) {
MPATTAuthorizationStatus mpStatus = (MPATTAuthorizationStatus)status;
NSNumber *timestampMillis = @(NSDate.now.timeIntervalSince1970 * 1000);
[MParticle.sharedInstance setATTStatus:mpStatus withATTStatusTimestampMillis:timestampMillis];
}];
Push Notifications
Push notifications work differently for web and for mobile.
Web
mParticle integrates with Braze to allow web push notifications to further engage your visitors. We integrated Braze’s S",19,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"oft Push Prompts, which allows you to ask your user if they’d like to stay in touch before the browser alerts them to allow notifications. This is done since the browser throttles how often you can prompt the user for push notifications, and if the user denies permission, you can never ask them again. See below for directions on how to implement push notifications, which customizes Braze’s implementation instructions to work with mParticle.
Configure your site
Create a service-worker.js file to your root directory. Inside your service-worker.js file, include
self.importScripts('https://static.mparticle.com/sdk/js/braze/service-worker-3.5.0.js');
mParticle hosts Braze’s service worker in order to prevent unpredictable versioning issues. Do not use Braze’s service-worker.js CDN.
Configure Safari Push
Generate a Safari Push Certificate following these “Registering with Apple” Instructions
In the Braze dashboard, on the app settings page (where your API keys are located), select your Web a",20,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"pp. Click “Configure Safari Push” and follow the instructions, uploading the push certificate you just generated.
In your mParticle dashboard, open your Braze connection settings. Under Safari Website Push ID, type in your Website Push ID you used when generating your Safari Push Certificate (beginning with web) and click Save.
Create a “Prime for Push” in-app messaging Campaign on the Braze dashboard. Note that this is an In-App Messaging Campaign, and not a Push Notification messaging campaign.
Make it a “Modal” In-App Message. Give it whatever text and styling you wish to present to the user (“Can we stay in touch?”).
Give the in-app message a Button 1 Text value of “OK” (or whatever affirmative text you wish), and set the On-Click Behavior to “Close Message.”
Under the gear composer section, add a key-value pair. Give it a key of msg-id and a value of push-primer.
You can create a prime-for-push custom event (or name it whatever you’d like) from the Braze dashboard. While still in ",21,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"the Braze dashboard, create a trigger action of whatever your custom event is (ie, prime-for-push). In the mParticle Braze connection settings, fill in the ""Soft Push"" Custom Event Name with your custom event name (ie. prime-for-push). When this field is filled, users will be sent the Soft Push Prompt on session load.
Optionally, you can change the name and location of service-worker.js. The following example will clarify the steps:
Let’s say that you want to rename your service-worker.js file to braze-push-worker.js and store it in inside a directory in your root folder called thirdParty/.
In your mParticle dashboard, open your Braze connection settings. Under Push Notification Service Worker File Location, type in /thirdParty/braze-push-worker.js and click Save.
Warning
- Setting a value here limits the scope of push notifications on your site. For instance, in the above example, because the service worker file is located within the /thirdParty/ directory, asking for push notificatio",22,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"ns MAY ONLY BE CALLED from web pages that start with http://your-site-name.com/thirdParty/.
Web Troubleshooting Tips
Firefox - starting with version 72, Firefox requires user interaction before showing a full push permission dialogue box. See here for more details.
Ensure that your OS-wide notifications for the browser you are testing are not disabled.
If you have previously allowed or rejected push requests while testing, you will need to clear local storage/cookies as well as the browser’s notification preference for your development URL for optimal testing.
Mobile
As long as the Braze Kit is included in your app, mParticle will pass any Push Notifications from Braze to the kit for display. However, you will need to provide credentials in the Braze dashboard.
See the main iOS and Android Push Notification documentation for more detail.
iOS App Launch Tracking
On iOS, when a user launches your app by tapping on a push notification, you may see these launches recorded in the mParticle ",23,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"dashboard but not in Braze. This happens due to a race condition between the Braze SDK initializing and the app handling the push notification.
To work around this, you’ll need to create your own instance of Braze in your applicationDidFinishLaunching method of your app delegate and pass it to the Braze kit before initializing the mParticle SDK. You’ll also need to tell the kit not to process push notifications and instead handle them yourself. This ensures that Braze is initialized and ready to receive the push notifications immediately upon app launch.
Note that by implementing your own instance of Braze, you will lose the ability to use the following Braze configuration options in the mParticle dashboard, as you’ll be passing those options to Braze yourself on app launch. Only implement this if you need push notification app launches reported to Braze:
Braze API Key
Braze Endpoint
Braze SDK Request Policy
Braze SDK Flush Interval
Braze SDK Session Timeout
Braze SDK Minimum Time Inte",24,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"rval Between Triggers
Braze SDK Disable Automatic Location Tracking
All other Braze configuration options in the mParticle dashboard will continue to work as usual, and any of the above can be set in your app when you create the Braze instance by setting the relevant options on the Braze configuration object. See the example code for the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method below.
The following is mostly following the instructions from Braze’s “Manual push integration” documentation, with the addition of some mParticle specific code in the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method.
Please note that because we are following Braze’s “Manual push integration” instructions, you should not set the configuration option, configuration.push.automation = true, as described in Braze’s Automatic push integration documentation as it will cause conflicts.
Make sure to import the Braze SDK and mParticle Braze kit in your app delegate file.

Special Considerations for mParticle A/B Testing With Braze and the mParticle SDK
mParticle supports the ability to conduct A/B testing with different integrations by sending a sample of users and their data to one integration and a different sample of users and their data to a different integration.
If you are using the mParticle SDK for Braze deployment and calling Braze methods directly, when instrumenting with the mParticle SDK you must ensure that the Braze kit is active in the App before calling a Braze method.
This is very important and ensures that you are not inadvertently calling Braze methods for apps/users that are not part of an Braze A/B sample.
Roku
mParticle supports the ability to forward server-side events for th",33,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"e Roku platform. Note that only data that includes your selected External Identity Type can be forwarded to Braze.
Data Processing Notes
mParticle will always forward events if sent via the mParticle SDK, provided you have included the Braze kit, but will only forward events sent via the mParticle S2S API if the following conditions apply:
The App Group REST API Key setting is specified.
Either your set External Identity Type, or a push token is specified.
Braze has limits on the number of characters in a property key - they must be less than or equal to 255 characters, with no leading dollar signs. When forwarding via a client-side kit, mParticle will remove the dollar sign ($) when forwarding property keys for user attributes, custom, and e-commerce events. When forwarding server-to-server, mParticle will remove the dollar sign ($) from mParticle reserved attributes.
Braze doesn't currently support timestamps before year 0 or after year 3000 in Time type custom attributes. Braze will",34,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event," ingest these values when they are sent by mParticle but the value will be stored as a String.
Braze Instance
Braze maintains several instances.
As part of the Configuration Settings, you need to specify which one your data should be forwarded to.
You can tell your Braze Instance from the URL of your Braze Dashboard.
Instance
Dashboard URL
US 01 Cluster
https://dashboard-01.braze.com

EU 02 Cluster
https://dashboard-02.braze.eu
Check with your Braze account manager if you are unsure which Braze instance you are using.
There is also the ability to specify a Custom instance, which allows you to specify separate endpoints for REST, SDK and Javascript.
Important: Your Custom Endpoin",35,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"t settings should be your URL's Authority. For example: sdk.iad-01.braze.com, not https://sdk.iad-01.braze.com.
Using https:// or a trailing / in your endpoint address will cause errors.
Prerequisites
In order to activate the Braze integration, you will need your Braze App Identifier API key and your “App Group REST API Key” if using the S2S API.
Sign into your Braze Account.
Click on Developer Console in the left navigation, then API Settings, Identification, and choose the Identifier for the platform you’re building to.
If you are sending data to mParticle via the S2S API, your “App Group REST API Key” value is required.
Click on the Developer Console in the left navigation to get this value.
Event Data Mapping
Commerce Events
Depending on the setting value for Bundle Commerce Event Data (see Connection Settings for more), Commerce Events may be expanded based on the number of products, promotions, or impressions, respectively. Ex:
If false, a single incoming event with 2 unique prod",36,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"ucts/promotions/impressions would result in at least 2 outgoing Braze events.
In true, a single incoming event with 2 unique products/promotions/impressions would result in 1 outgoing event with a nested products[], promotions[] or impressions[] array, respectively.
If you are using all three platforms, make sure you determine whether or not you want products in Braze to be identified by their SKU or by their product name. Because of prior implementations, iOS and Android send the SKU by default while Web sends the product name. Check out the [Connection Settings](#connection-settings) 'Replace SKU as Braze Product Name' and 'Map Product Name to Product ID' settings if you'd like to ensure matching data from all platforms.

Screen Views
Your screen view events will be passed to Braze using the screen name that you passed to our logScreen SDK method, as the event name.
If you are using automatic screen tracking in our Android SDK, the automatically-generated screen view events will be forwarded to Braze using the name of the associated Activity class.
Session Start / End
To send session start and end events for S2S to Braze, enable the Forward Session Events connection setting. After enabling this setting, session start and end events are forwarded to Braze as custom events with the names Session Start and Session End. When available",44,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,", session IDs are also sent in the session_id property on all session starts and ends, screen view, and custom events.
However, note that mParticle SDK kits do not support session events, which are never forwarded with a kit, whether or not Forward Session Events is enabled.
When creating segmentation filters within Braze, make sure to use the custom event filters for session data rather than the session filters.
Custom Events
All custom events will be forwarded to Braze using the event name that you passed to your logEvent SDK method.
All event attributes will be forwarded to Braze as Braze custom event properties using the attribute names you passed to your logEvent SDK method as well.
Note: Braze documentation indicates that the following reserved keywords can’t be used as custom event properties:

mParticle estimates the user’s date of birth by subtracting $Age from the current year, and using January 1st as the month and day.
For example, if $Age is 10 and the current year is 2014, we’ll forward the user’s date of birth as 2004-01-01. If an exact birth date is desired, set a user attribute called dob with user’s birth date. When both $Age and dob user attributes are sent, one value may override the other when mParticle forwards data to Braze. So it is recommended that one of them is toggled Off in mParticle’s data filter for Braze.

It will be set to opted_in when called with a value of true and will be set to unsubscribed when called with a value of false. Email subscription statuses can also be updated server side by setting the user attribute email_subscribe with a value of subscribed, unsubscribed, or opted_in, which correspond to the Global Subscription States in Braze. This will not be set as a custom attribute in Braze, it’ll appear in Contact Settings.
User Attribute push_subscribe
push_subscribe
Push subscription status can be updated server side by setting the user attribute push_subscribe with a value of subscribed, unsubscribed, or opted_in, which correspond to the Global Subscription States in Braze. This will not be set as a custom attribute in Braze, it’ll appear in Contact Settings.
push_tokens
Because Braze can only accept a single push token for each app/user pair, we will forward the most recently-registered push token to Braze per",47,integrations_braze_event.txt

User Identity of type Facebook
facebook
User Identity of type Twitter
twitter
Braze advises to coerce data types on user attributes shared with Braze before sending Production volume data. This ensures that the custom attributes received by Braze are of the expected data type. This can impact segment building and triggering campaigns.
If incorrect data types are identified after data has been flowing, there can be extra work to true up the users with the legacy data type on those attributes.
To give Braze’s type detection a better opportunity to evaluate data types properly, you can enable the following 2 Connection Settings: Enable API Custom Attribute Type Detection and Enable Kit Custom Attribute Type Detection.
Enriched Attributes and Identities
By default, mParticle forwards all available user attributes and user identities to Braze, including attributes added during profile enrichment. You can disable this behavior in the Connection Settings.
Only data which is",48,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event," sent to Braze Server to Server can be enriched.
Subscription Groups
A User Attribute can be mapped to a Braze Subscription Group ID. Requests sent to mParticle containing the mapped User Attribute, with a valid true or false value, will determine if the user in the request should be subscribed (true) or unsubscribed (false) from the group. This allows for dynamic subscription management based on user attributes.
To configure Subscription Group Mapping:
Create the Subscription Group in Braze, if it doesn’t already exist.
Map the desired User Attribute to the Subscription Group ID in the mParticle dashboard.
Note that the User Attribute must be sent to mParticle at least once before it is available for mapping.
Send the mapped User Attribute on your event batch to mParticle with a boolean value.
true: User will be subscribed to the Braze Subscription Group.
false: User will be unsubscribed from the Braze Subscription Group.
Other non-boolean values will be ignored.
Subscription Group Er",49,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"rors
A misconfigured Subscription Group mapping can affect how your data is forwarded to Braze. If you notice your Subscription Groups are not being updated, check the following:
Invalid Subscription Group ID: Ensure the mapped Subscription Group IDs are correct in your Connection Settings.
Deleted Subscription Group: If a Subscription Group is deleted in Braze, you must update or remove the mapping in the mParticle dashboard.
Invalid User Attribute: Ensure the mapped User Attribute is being sent to mParticle with a boolean value.
Please note that Braze will only return an error in these cases when the Subscription Group attribute update is the only item in the request sent to Braze. If the request contains valid events and/or purchases, Braze will process these and skip the Subscription Group update. This also means that you will only see Subscription Group errors in the System Alerts page when the invalid Subscription Group update is the only item in the request.
Consent
To adhere to",50,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event," the EU user consent policy, Braze is enforcing the consent field to be populated for EU users.
Braze uses the $google_ad_user_data and $google_ad_personalization custom attribute keys to receive consent status for Google’s EU User Consent Policy. The Boolean sent to these keys signify that a user has granted or denied consent to a marketer. As per their Collecting consent for EEA, UK, and Switzerland end users documentation, this value must be sent to Google as a Custom Attribute.
User-specified Consent
To configure user consent forwarding under this value, a mapping should be set-up leveraging mParticle’s notion of Consent Purposes. To learn more about handling user consent within mParticle’s platform, see the following docs: Data Privacy Controls.
Once a Consent Purpose is set up, user consent information can be associated with it in subsequent Event Batches. The Consent Purpose data mapping can then be configured for downstream forwarding via the Consent Mapping connection setting.",51,integrations_braze_event.txt

Automatically display new in-app messages when they come in from the server.
Forward Page Name as Braze Event Name
bool
False
Web
If enabled, the Page Name that is sent to Braze is the first argument in mParticle.logPageView(“PageName”). Otherwise the path will be used. For S2S requests, enabling this setting will send the event name as-is. Otherwise Viewed will be added to the event name.
Replace SKU as Braze Product Name
bool
False
Web
If enabled, the SKU replaces Product Name when sent to Braze. By default, Web sends Product Name to Braze. New customers should check this to be consistent with iOS/Android which sends SKU by default.

Disable loading of FontAwesome from the FontAwesome CDN. Note that if you do this, you are responsible for ensuring that FontAwesome is loaded - otherwise in-app messages may not render correctly.
Enable API Custom Attribute Type Detection
enum
None
S2S API
Send custom attributes with parsed data types for User Attributes, Event Attributes, both, or neither.
The following data types are evaluated, in this order, for a match to determine data type to include with the message to Braze: Boolean, Long (covers integer), Double (covers decimal), Date, String (if none else are true). This supports data point triggers in Braze that may require a specific data type. Data points can be automatically detected in Braze or forced. A list of the data types that Braze supports are here. The $Zip user attribute is exempt from type detection and will always be sent as a string.

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"Web
By default, all kits (except for web) send custom attributes as strings unless they are special Braze reserved attributes. Checking this will force custom attributes to be sent as parsed data types where possible. Please note that Braze refers to these as Custom Attributes or Properties in the case of Events and Purchases. The $Zip user attribute is exempt from type detection and will always be sent as a string.

Braze Web Kit Critical Updates and Timelines
Braze occasionally makes breaking changes to their SDK, so if you call Braze directly in your code, you will have to update your code to ensure your website performs as expected when updating versions of Braze.
Opt In to Braze SDK Version 5
We recommend you use version 5 of the Braze SDK.
You only need to make code changes if you directly call the Braze SDK from your code. Otherwise, you can simply select Version 5 from the mParticle connection settings.
If you are upgrading from V3, you should check the breaking changes from the Braze V4 Changelog as well as Braze V5 Changelog, in addition to the V4/5 migration guide to learn about the breaking chan",62,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"ges.
The most significant breaking changes are the replacement of the appboy class name with braze from V3 to V4, in addition to the removal and renaming of several APIs.
If you are updating from V4 to V5, there are fewer changes, but you’d follow the same defensive code recommendations below.
You can opt into the latest major version of the Braze Web SDK whether you implement mParticle’s Web SDK using npm or our snippet/CDN.
Customers who self-host mParticle via npm - You should add @mparticle/web-braze-kit version 5.0.0 or greater in your package.json.
You must also select Version 5 under Braze Web SDK Version
in the Braze connection settings.
Customers who load mParticle via snippet/CDN - You must
select Version 5 under Braze Web SDK Version
in the Braze connection settings.
Note that the following is only one example, and demonstrates an upgrade from V3 to V5.
Everywhere you manually call appboy (or other deprecated API) needs to be updated similar to the below. If you are using NP",63,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"M, you can skip to step 4.
Please be sure to test your site fully in development prior to releasing.
Step 1: Legacy code sample. Find all the places where your code references the appboy.display namespace.
Braze has removed all instances of the display namespace:
window.appboy.display.destroyFeed();
Step 2: Roll out code changes to be used before you opt in to using Version 4 of the Braze Web SDK so that it works under both versions:
if (window.appboy) {
window.appboy.display.destroyFeed();
} else if (window.braze) {
window.braze.destroyFeed();
}
Step 3: Whether you are using the snippet or self-hosting, you need to navigate to your Braze connection settings and select Version 5 from the Braze Web SDK Version drop down.
Step 4: After you opt in, you can simplify your code. We recommend testing and waiting at least 24 hours between opting in and removing previous instances of appboy and doing thorough testing of your application in a development environment to ensure everything is worki",64,integrations_braze_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event,"ng:
window.braze.destroyFeed();
Step 4: Push Notifications via service-worker.js
If you use Push Notifications, we have updated the service-worker.js file.
In our testing, Braze’s push notifications work as expected regardless of what version of the service-worker is used, but we recommend updating this file to ensure future compatibility.
In your service-worker.js file, update the code to reference https://static.mparticle.com/sdk/js/braze/service-worker-5.5.0.js instead of https://static.mparticle.com/sdk/js/braze/service-worker-3.5.0.js.
Your service-worker.js file should now contain:
self.imports('https://static.mparticle.com/sdk/js/braze/service-worker-5.5.0.js')
Transition from @mparticle/web-appboy-kit to @mparticle/web-braze-kit
The legacy @mparticle/web-appboy-kit from NPM includes version 2 of the Braze Web SDK.
As part of this update, we’ve created a new Braze web kit repo to replace our deprecated Appboy web kit repo.

It collects data from any number of inputs - mobile apps, web, feeds from external SAAS providers, data sent via our Events API - and forwards it on to output services to be used for analytics, attribution, storage, audience targeting, push notifications, etc.
The primary task accomplished in the mParticle dashboard is creating Connections between inputs and outputs - to collect your data, enrich and transform it, and forward it to where it needs to go. mP",9,guides_platform-guide_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,"article forwards two main types of data:
Events data is about what users do in your app. Opening your app, logging in, viewing a screen and making a purchase can all be captured with Events data. For example, you might track the average number of sessions per user over a given period of time as a way of measuring user engagement with your app.
Audience data captures groups of users that meet a given set of criteria. For example, you might create an audience of users who have purchased icecream from your app and forward that audience to a marketing automation platform, to target messages to those users when new dairy products become available.
Accounts, organizations, and workspaces
mParticle creates a unique organization for you. It’s the container for all data and metadata related to your mParticle. Within an organization, mParticle will create one or more accounts for you, and within each account, you can create one or more workspaces. Your choices for account and workspace setup are",10,guides_platform-guide_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/," important because these choices affect identity and feature provisioning.
These three nested containers provide scoping and functionality for multi-brand and multi-geo use cases, as well as edge use cases. The scope and advantages of each are explained in the following sections.
Organization
Most mParticle customers have one organization which contains one or more accounts. However, some large companies have multiple organizations. No information is shared across organization boundaries. mParticle creates the organization(s) for you.
A few features apply at the organization level, including profile strategies.
You can think of the organization as representing your company.
Account
Each organization has one or more accounts. Accounts often represent different functional groups or goals within an organization, for example regional divisions, or Sales, Marketing, and Customer Support. mParticle creates the account(s) for you.
Some information is shared across accounts either by default o",11,guides_platform-guide_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,"r by enablement:
Audiences can be shared across account boundaries with cross-account sharing enabled.
mParticle users (people authorized to access your mParticle organization) are shared across accounts and workspaces.
User data is shared across workspaces by default, but you can request it be shared across accounts.
Workspace
Each account contains one or more workspaces. A workspace is the basic container for data in an mParticle account.
mParticle creates your first workspace, but you can add more at any time.
For most use cases, each workspace is its own domain, separate from other workspaces. Some information is shared across workspace boundaries:
Audiences are shared, allowing you to build an audience using data from more than one workspace.
mParticle users (people authorized to access your mParticle organization) are shared across accounts and workspaces.
Some mParticle accounts have over a dozen workspaces, while others have only one. How you organize data from your app ecosyst",12,guides_platform-guide_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,"em is entirely up to you.
Using organizations, accounts, and workspaces
Use organizations, accounts, and workspaces to manage multiple brands, regions, and to manage custom identity configurations and unique input/output requirements.
You can also use mParticle features like cross-account audience sharing or multiple workspace real-time audiences.
To see which accounts and organizations are available:
To display your current organization and account, log into mParticle and in the left navigation bar toward the bottom, click the buildings icon. If more than one organization or account has been created, you’ll be able to search for it.
To see your current workspace name, log into mParticle and in the left navigation bar, the square in the upper left corner displays your current workspace name. Click anywhere in the square to search for other workspaces or see the settings for this workspace.
Example: Multiple brands, multiple locations
The Best Bags company sells handbags under several d",13,guides_platform-guide_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,"ifferent names, and in several regions of the globe. They can use organizations and workspaces to provide differentiation when needed:
Best Bags created workspaces that correspond to three regions: North America, APAC, and Europe. Each brand defines their own audiences and users within a separate organization, since most customers purchase from only one region.
Best Bags created accounts that correspond to their different brands: BestieBags, BlingBags, and CarriageBest. In this way, they can create unique inputs and outputs for the same data sources and forwarding destinations, address different governance and compliance requirements, while still being able to share audience membership, since their customers may buy different brands at different times.
You can also use identity scope to manage how user data is shared between workspaces and accounts. And if you need to share audiences across accounts, you can request that mParticle enable cross-account audience sharing for your organiza",14,guides_platform-guide_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,"tion.
Managing workspaces
Click on the name of your current workspace in the top-left corner of the dashboard to open the workspaces menu. From here you can switch into any of your current workspaces, or click Settings to open the Workspace Settings page.
From the Workspace Settings page, you can:
View daily, monthly and quarterly statistics across all workspaces in this account, including data from both development and production environments.
Browse a list of all workspaces in your account.
Download the Event Volume Report, which lists all events ingested in the selected timeframe. The report provides visibility into the calculated attributes and audiences created using those events. This is the same report you can download from Data Master > Catalog > Download Report.
Create a new workspace - all you need to do is provide a name for the new workspace.
Delete a workspace - this will also delete all the workspace data and connection settings. This action cannot be undone, so proceed w",15,guides_platform-guide_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,"ith caution.
Edit a workspace - view the Apple App Transparency Tracking (ATT) Defaults, enable GDPR and CCPA regulations, and retrieve the workspace Key/Secret to use with the OpenDSR API.
Note that you can’t delete a workspace that is part of a Multi Workspace Audience. First delete or modify the multiworkspace audience, then you can delete the workspace.
Working with web data
mParticle handles Web data — collected from a browser client — a little differently from data collected from native apps.
In most cases, data collected by the mParticle SDK is sent to mParticle, and then forwarded on to integration partners server-to-server.
There are exceptions to this rule: in cases where a server-to-server integration cannot support all the required functionality of an integration partner, an Embedded Kit may be used. Embedded Kits are extra components added to the mParticle SDK that communicate directly with an integration partner from the app client.
While direct communication between the ",16,guides_platform-guide_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,"client and partner is the exception for native apps, it is common for web data. A key reason for this is that most of mParticle’s integration partners are not set up to receive web data server-to-server, as they rely on cookie data only accessible to the cookie owner. To support these integrations, the mParticle Web SDK uses the following workflow:
On initialization, the SDK checks to see which Web integrations are enabled for your workspace.
For each enabled integration, mParticle SDK will fetch the Partner’s javascript and the mParticle wrapper specific to that Partner. For example, if you have enabled the Google Analytics integration, the mParticle SDK will fetch Google’s analytics.js snippet and mParticle’s GoogleAnalyticsEventForwarder.js snippet. We fetch only the integrations that you have enabled in order to keep the page size to a minimum.
Any supported events are mapped directly onto the equivalent partner method. For example, when the mParticle SDK logs a Page View it automa",17,guides_platform-guide_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,"tically calls Google Analytics’ pageview method.
// Example from GoogleAnalyticsEventForwarder.js
// When mParticle logs a Page View, it automatically calls this function, which invokes Google's `analytics.js` snippet to send the page view to Google Analytics
function logPageView() {
if (forwarderSettings.classicMode == 'True') {
_gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);
}
else {
ga(createCmd('send'), 'pageview');
}
}
To make it easier to work with web integrations, we provide the source code in a public repository, so you can work with the Integration Partner’s documentation and see exactly how we map mParticle methods onto the Partner code. See the mparticle-integrations organization for a complete list of client-side web integrations.
Platform limits
mParticle imposes limits on the number and length of attributes that can be associated with events and users.
A quick summary of some of the most important limits is below. For more information, see our full Default Service Limits guide.
Events
An",18,guides_platform-guide_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/," event can have up to 100 attribute key/value pairs.
Event names and attribute keys are limited to 256 characters.
Event attribute values are limited to 4096 characters.
Users
A user can have up to 100 attribute key/value pairs.
User attribute names, including user identities like email or Customer ID, are limited to 256 characters.
A user attribute value can be a list. These lists are limited to 1000 entries.
An entry in a user attribute list is limited to 512 characters.
A user attribute value that is not part of a list is limited to 4096 characters.
Note that Output Services often have their own limits, which can differ from mParticle’s. When planning your implementation, check the documentation for your Output Services in the Integration Center to make sure you are complying with their limits.
Tracking protection
Browsers add third-party tracking protection for end users. The protections affect third-party trackers and their cookies and work in different ways. For example, Firefox ",19,guides_platform-guide_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,"Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) relies on a list of known trackers to decide what to block. Safari, Chrome for iOS and other browsers with the Apple WebKit engine use Intelligent Tracking Protection (ITP). ITP prevents the browser from loading cookies from a third-party domain.
mParticle aligns with this privacy stance.
Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP)
Apple WebKit engine and ITP
User attributes and event attributes
mParticle ingests data points that are composed of event attributes and user attributes.
User attributes and input source priority
For a given user, attributes are stord at the workspace level, not the device level.
User attributes are ingested according to the following priority:
Calculated attributes
Account-level attributes (a premium feature)
Custom feed input
SDK input
Custom CSV
Partner data feed (PDF), for example the Punchh integration is a partner data feed.
Once ingested from a particular source type, subsequent source types for that same data won’t b",20,guides_platform-guide_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,"e ingested. For example, once you set a user attribute key value using the Web SDK, you won’t be able to set that same value from a partner data feed.
Timestamps and ingested data
When mParticle ingests data, there are two timestamps associated with events:
Each event batch has a timestamp.
Each event in the batch may have a timestamp.
If batches or events have a timestamp that is more than 15 minutes in the future, relative to the server processing the data, that timestamp will be reset to the current server UTC time. Attribute timestamps remain unchanged.
If you load data using CSV Import, the batch timestamp is reset to the current server UTC time.
Forward-looking statements
mParticle strives to be as transparent as possible. Part of this transparency is to share information about products, features, or functionality that we expect to deliver in the future.
Forward-looking statements are as accurate as possible given the knowledge at the time of publication. However, no purchasing d",21,guides_platform-guide_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/,"ecisions should be made on the basis of any forward-looking statement, and mParticle may withdraw or change the products, features, or functionality mentioned in such statements.
Next steps
To get started with mParticle, set up some data inputs and integrate with at least one output service. See Web End-to-End Tutorial for instructions on how to set up connections, and see your first data flow from input to output. If you aren’t working with Web apps or services, visit Getting Started for more generic instructions.
Once you’re up and running, see the rest of this Platform guide for a more advanced look at the mParticle dashboard, or browse Integrations to see all available integrations.

Listen for SDK Initialization
The web SDK loads asynchronously and is therefore not immediately available for use. However, this snippet creates stubbed versions of several mParticle APIs such that your function invocations are queued until the SDK loads. The following APIs are stubbed for you and will be placed on a function queue when invoked after the snippet but prior to when the SDK loads:
logEvent()
logPageView()
See the latest prettified snippet on Github for a complete list
You may also add any function to a generic queue via the mParticle.ready() helper method and it will be ",12,developers_client-sdks_web_initialization_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/initialization/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/initialization/,"invoked once the SDK loads:
window.mParticle.ready(
function() {
console.log('mParticle has loaded!');
// !! Note: do not attempt to access the user object at this point
// !! var user = window.mParticle.Identity.getCurrentUser();
// !! Instead, access the user object via the mParticle.config.identityCallback option
}
);
Initial identification request
The web SDK does the following on every page load:
Detects if there is an active session in the current or any other browser tab
If an active session is not found, the SDK constructs an IDSync request containing the most recent user identities from the previous browser session. You can manually specify the IDSync request via the identifyRequest property of your mParticle.config object.
If an active session is found, then no IDSync HTTP request is performed
Regardless of whether an IDSync HTTP request is performed, the SDK will invoke the IDSync callback function described below.
A common use-case is to access the mParticle user object imm",13,developers_client-sdks_web_initialization_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/initialization/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/initialization/,"ediately on page load. The best way to do this is to specify a function as the identityCallback property of your mParticle.config object:
window.mParticle = {
config: {
identifyRequest: {
userIdentities: {
email:
'email@example.com',
customerid: '123456'
}
},
identityCallback: function(result) {
//This is the quickest way to acquire a reference to the user object
//this callback is invoked on every page load
if (result.getUser()) {
result.getUser().setUserAttribute('foo', 'bar');
}
}
}
};
See the IDSync documentation for more information on building a complete IDSync request.
Device Id (Device Application Stamp)
When the Web SDK initializes, mParticle generates a random UUIDv4-formatted string to be the browser’s device id (Device Application Stamp, or das).
mParticle allows developers to retrieve this by calling mParticle.getDeviceId().
The device ID is unique to each browser’s persistence layer. This means that a new device ID is generated for each browser, so if a user uses multiple",14,developers_client-sdks_web_initialization_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/initialization/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/initialization/," browsers, then their MPID will have multiple device IDs associated with it.
Additionally, if a user clears cookies/local storage, or uses a browser’s private browsing mode (ie. incognito mode), a new instance of persistence is created, resulting in another device ID.
Furthermore, if multiple people use the same computer and browser (ie. families, public computers), then a single device ID will be associated with multiple users.
mParticle allows an advanced use case for our customers to set the device ID via two different methods:
During initialization - set window.mParticle.config.deviceId.
Mid session - call mParticle.setDeviceId('UUIDv2-formatted-string').
Note that an invalid device ID will result in data not reaching our servers, so we recommend doing lots of manual testing if configuring the device ID.
One use case is passing the device ID between an iFrame and parent page when mParticle is on both pages. In this case, you should call getDeviceId from one level (for example the i",15,developers_client-sdks_web_initialization_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/initialization/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/web/initialization/,"Frame) and send that value to the other (for example the parent page).Was this page helpful?YesNoLast Updated: February 27, 2025© 2025 mParticle, Inc.

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/android/overview/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/android/overview/,"ow to integrate the Android SDK from start to finish
To demonstrate how mParticle works, you will learn how to track basic event data like page views and purchase events in a web app using the mParticle Android SDK. Then, you will learn how to send that data to a webhook. You will also learn how to manage your data quality by creating a data plan.
mParticle is extremely flexible. There are thirteen SDKs for specific platforms like web, iOS, and Android, in addition to several APIs. mParticle also provides over 250 integrations with data warehouse, analytics, and marketing automation tools.
To keep your first steps with mParticle quick and easy, this tutorial uses the Android SDK and a sample ecommerce app called The Higgs Shop.
This is a technical tutorial for developers. If you aren’t a developer, you can find a general introduction to mParticle in the Platform Guide.
About the Android SDK
mParticle’s Android SDK supports all Android devices and tablets, including Amazon Fire TV.

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/android/overview/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/android/overview/,"nitializing the Android SDK in your app, you gain access to useful methods you can call in your app’s code to send events and user data to mParticle.
Prerequisites
Access to an mParticle instance
In order to begin sending data from your app to mParticle, you will need access to an mParticle account and an API key.
Download the mParticle sample app
This tutorial demonstrates how mParticle works using The Higgs Shop, a sample Android application written in the Kotlin programming language.
Open your terminal or command prompt, and clone the Android sample app repository on GitHub.
Open the sample app in your IDE and configure your virtual device
If you don’t already have Android Studio installed on your computer, download and install the correction version for your OS now. You may use another IDE, but we recommend Android Studio.
Open your cloned directory for the Android sample app in Android Studio or your IDE of choice.

Click Create device.
Select a device category and name in the modal window. We recommend Phone and any version of Pixel. Click Next.
Select or download one of the recommended system images and click Next.
After entering an AVD Name for your configuration, select the Portrait orientation (selected by default), and click Finish.
With your new virtual device configured, click Run in the top toolbar to ensure that you can successfully build the sample app.
It may take up to 2 minutes to launch the sample app.
Since you haven’t added your API key and secret to the sample app yet, you will receive a warning message. You will generate and add your API key and secret in the next step.
For now, ignore the API key warning that appears. In the next step, you will create and add your API key and secret before restarting the sample app.

Profiles: a profile represents a complete picture of what you’ve learned about a given user over time, across all of your channels, continuously updated and maintained in real time as you capture new data. You then use this data in audiences or journeys.
Calculated attributes: measure your users’ aggregate behaviors, and store ",9,guides_personalization_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/,"this information in new user attributes, such as customer lifetime value, total games played or content watched, or the last product viewed. Then you can use the calculated attribute in audience or journey criteria.
Audiences: define audiences and connect them to integrations for the purpose of engaging with your users. This can be very powerful when it comes to user engagement and monetization scenarios. You can define audiences from any user-associated data you capture with mParticle, whether from platform inputs or partner feeds.
Journeys: move away from simple cross-channel engagement toward an organization-wide customer journey strategy. Journeys help you to perform journey analysis, testing, and orchestration in a single workflow.

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/audience,"nceZendeskEventFeedQuadratic LabsEventZ2A DigitalEventAudienceQualtricsEventAudienceBraze is a comprehensive customer engagement platform that powers relevant experiences between consumers and brands they love. Braze helps brands foster human connection through interactive conversations across channels.
mParticle audiences correspond to Braze’s Segments feature and can be used to target engagement campaigns in Braze.
Prerequisites
In order to activate our Braze integration, you’re going to need the API key for each app that you’d like to set up, which can be found by logging into your Braze account and navigating to your app’s settings. You will also need to create an App Group REST API Key in the Developer Console.
Braze Instance
Braze maintains several instances. As part of the Configuration Settings, you need to specify which one your data should be forwarded to.
You can tell your Braze Instance from the URL of your Braze Dashboard.

EU 02 Cluster

Check with your Braze account manager if you are unsure which Braze instance you are using.
There is also the ability to specify a Custom instance, which allows you to specify separate endpoints for REST, SDK and Javascript.
Important: Your Custom Endpoint settings should be your URL's Authority. For example: sdk.iad-01.braze.com, not https://sdk.iad-01.braze.com.
Using https:// or a trailing / in your endpoint address will cause errors.
User Identity Mapping
mParticle will attempt to match users in Braze based on IDFAs, Android Device IDs, and a customizable External User ID field, which uniquely identifies a user i",15,integrations_braze_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/audience,"n Braze. You can set which Identity Type to use as the External User ID in the Configuration Settings. Your External User ID should be a unique, permanent identifier — usually Customer ID or Email. If you are also using the Event integration, make sure you set the same External User ID across both integrations.
Forwarding Audiences
The Braze API does not allow mParticle to directly create and maintain membership of segments in Braze, so the Audience integration works by setting attributes on a user, which you can then use to define a corresponding segment in Braze. Like mParticle, Braze populates it’s Segment Manager based on the actual data points received, so you need to create audiences in mParticle and connect them to Braze first. Then, provided your audience is not empty, the segment membership attributes should become available in the Braze Segment Manager within a few minutes.
mParticle offers seven ways to set segment membership attributes, controlled by the Send Segments As Co",16,integrations_braze_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/audience,"nfiguration Setting. The drop-down has the following options:
Single String Attribute (default)
Single Array Attribute
One Attribute Per Segment
Both Single Array Attribute and Single String Attribute
Both Single Array Attribute and One Attribute Per Segment
Both Single String Attribute and One Attribute Per Segment
Single Array Attribute, Single String Attribute, and One Attribute Per Segment
These options will be explained in further detail below.
Sample Audience Membership
Note that Audience IDs can be found in the main Audience list view.
For example, note the Audience IDs for these three audiences:
13053
13052
13051
Single String Attribute
Warning: Braze string attributes have a max length of 255 characters. If your users' audience memberships are being truncated, choose one of the options involving `Single Array Attribute` instead.
This is the default behavior.
mParticle creates a single custom attribute in Braze for each user, called SegmentMembership. The value of this attribut",17,integrations_braze_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/audience,"e is a comma-separated string of mParticle audience IDs that match the user.
Using the above examples, a user who is a member of Test Audience 1, Test Audience 2, and Test Audience 3 will show the attribute SegmentMembership with a value of ""'13053','13052', '13051'"" in Braze.
See the Sample Braze Profile for an example.
To target members of Test Audience 1, for example, you need to create a matching segment in Braze using the mParticle Audience ID,
with the filter SegmentMembership — matches regex — 13051. It’s important to choose the matches regex option, and not equals, or users with membership in more than one audience will not be matched.
Warning: Do not select `Single Attribute` for multiple configurations using the same credentials and cluster. Each configuration will send its own set of audience IDs to the same profile in Braze which will cause them to overwrite each other. If you need to use multiple configurations, please use the `Single Attribute` for at most one configurati",18,integrations_braze_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/audience,"on and use `One Attribute Per Segment` for others.
Single Array Attribute
Warning: Braze array attributes have a max length of 25. If any of your users are members of >25 audiences, membership info will be truncated by Braze. To work around this, contact your Braze representative to increase your max array length threshold.
mParticle creates a single custom array attribute in Braze for each user, called SegmentMembershipArray. The value of this attribute is an array of mParticle audience IDs that match the user.
Using the above examples, a user who is a member of Test Audience 1, Test Audience 2, and Test Audience 3 will show the attribute SegmentMembershipArray with a value of [""13053"",""13052"", ""13051""] in Braze. Note, however, that Braze parses array attributes to make them more readable.
See the Sample Braze Profile for an example.
To target members of Test Audience 1, for example, you need to create a matching segment in Braze with the filter SegmentMembershipArray — includes value",19,integrations_braze_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/audience," — 13051
One Attribute Per Segment
mParticle creates a custom attribute in Braze for each audience that a user belongs to, based on the External Name of the audience.
Using the above examples, a user who is a member of audience Test Audience 1 will show the attribute In Test Audience 1 is true in Braze.
To target members of Test Audience 1, for example, you need to create a matching segment in Braze with the filter In Test Audience 1 — equals — true.
Both Single Array Attribute and Single String Attribute
mParticle will send attributes as described by both Single Array Attribute and Single String Attribute.
Both Single Array Attribute and One Attribute Per Segment
mParticle will send attributes as described by both Single Array Attribute and One Attribute Per Segment.
Both Single String Attribute and One Attribute Per Segment
mParticle will send attributes as described by both Single String Attribute and One Attribute Per Segment.

Since mParticle does not directly maintain segments in Braze, it will not delete segments when the corresponding mParticle audience connection is deleted or deactivated. When this happens, mParticle will not update the audience user attributes in Braze to remove the audience from each user.
Deleting an Audience
Deleting an audience does not remove the custom attributes in Braze.

You can use this technique in all regions and with all outputs.
Use the following process to load user attribute or event data from CSV files:
1. Create CSV files
File guidelines
Data guidelines
2. Get credentials for the mParticle SFTP server
3. Configure the Custom CSV Feed
4. Drop CSV files on the SFTP server
1. Create CSV files
Prepare the CSV files for ",9,guides_csv_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,"import. Files must follow the guidelines in this section.
File guidelines
Files must adhere to the RFC4180 standards for CSV formatting.
Files must be sent in one of the following formats:
A plain CSV (.csv)
A ZIP file containing one or more CSV files (.zip)
A gzipped CSV (.csv.gz).
A PGP/GPG-encrypted file with the additional extension .gpg appended, for example, .csv.gpg or .csv.gz.gpg). Only encrypted OR unencrypted files can be accepted, but not both.
You must use PGP encryption with mParticle’s public key. See Encrypted files for additional instructions.
File sizes should be between 5 MB and 2 GB. If you upload files outside these limits, processing speed is slower. If possible, split the data across multiple small files, because their processing can be parallelized.
Each file can only contain events of the same event type. You can’t mix events of different types in the same file.
Don’t use subfolders.
Each row size should be under 80 KB. Larger rows may impact performance.
All co",10,guides_csv_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,"lumn names must be unique.
Each CSV file must contain fewer than 50 columns.
File name requirements:
Do not use any dashes ( - ) or dots ( . ) in your file name, other than what is described below.
End the file name based on the event content in your file:
-custom_event.csv
-commerce_event.csv
-screen_view.csv
-eventless.csv for eventless uploads of user identities and attributes
Column names: specify fields according to our JSON Schema, using dot notation.
Column names described are case sensitive.
Data guidelines
Environment: include a column name environment set to development or production. If an environment column is not included, data is ingested into the production environment.
User and Device IDs: as with any data sent to mParticle, you must include a column with at least one user ID or device ID.
Device IDs
device_info.android_advertising_id
device_info.android_uuid
device_info.ios_advertising_id
device_info.att_authorization_status
device_info.ios_idfv
device_info.roku_advert",11,guides_csv_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,"ising_id
device_info.roku_publisher_id
device_info.fire_advertising_id
device_info.microsoft_advertising_id
User IDs
mpid
user_identities.customerid
user_identities.email
user_identities.facebook
user_identities.microsoft
user_identities.twitter
user_identities.yahoo
user_identities.other
user_identities.other2
user_identities.other3
user_identities.other4
Important: CSV files must have all the required identity columns, and the rows must have valid values in those columns to prevent processing errors.
User attributes:
If you include user attributes, for each, include a column named as user_attributes.key, where key is a user attribute key. For example:
user_attributes.$FirstName
user_attributes.communication_preference
user_attributes.Member Tier
Attribute names with spaces are allowed and do not require quotes. All the keys listed in the JSON Reference are supported.
Events:
Use a column named events.data.timestamp_unixtime_ms to set the event time.
Use a column named
events.data.cus",12,guides_csv_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,"tom_attributes.key, where key is an event attribute key, to set custom event attributes.
Attribute names with spaces are allowed and do not require quotes. All the keys listed in the JSON Reference are supported.
Screen view events: use a column named events.data.screen_name if you want to include the screen name.
Custom events: use columns named events.data.event_name and events.data.custom_event_type to include custom events.
Commerce events: use columns with the following names for commerce events.
events.data.product_action.action
events.data.product_action.products.id
events.data.product_action.products.name
events.data.product_action.products.category
events.data.product_action.products.brand
events.data.product_action.products.variant
events.data.product_action.products.position
events.data.product_action.products.price
events.data.product_action.products.quantity
events.data.product_action.products.coupon_code
events.data.product_action.products.added_to_cart_time_ms
events.dat",13,guides_csv_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,"a.product_action.products.total_product_amount
events.data.product_action.products.custom_attributes
Only one product per event can be included for commerce events uploaded via CSV.
Data types:
All data in the CSV is converted to a string. The only exceptions to this are values that require a particular data type, such as MPID or IDFA.
Only standard custom events and screen views, and eventless batches (eventless drops of user identity and attributes), have been tested.
Attributes sent as arrays are not fully supported. When the entire array is present in a single cell of the CSV file, it is supported and is converted to string. Because there is no way of specifying anything but the first item in an array, repeated header columns, each subsequent column overwrites the previous one. Multiple columns don’t append to the array. This is why you can only include one product for ecommerce events. Commerce events in the Events API support arrays in multiple places, but with CSV files, you can",14,guides_csv_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/," only populate a single item in each of these arrays.
Custom manifest: You can use a custom manifest to drop files created in another system without transforming them. For details, see Use a custom manifest.
2. Get credentials for the mParticle SFTP server
mParticle maintains an SFTP server where you will drop your CSV files.
Use the following instructions to securely retrieve your credentials and find the hostname and path to use when you drop your files on the SFTP server.
To get your SFTP username and password:
Sign up for a Keybase account with your work email at https://keybase.io/. Keybase is a secure tool which includes end-to-end encrypted chat.
Provide your Keybase account name to your Customer Success Manager or your mParticle Solutions Consultant so that they can pass it on to our Ops team.
Expect to receive your SFTP access credentials in a Keybase chat from mParticle. Note that if you need to use credentials that you already have, you’ll share those credentials in the Keyb",15,guides_csv_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,"ase chat.
3. Configure the Custom CSV Feed
Configure the Custom CSV Feed as input. This step provides the hostname and folder path on the SFTP server where your CSV files must be dropped.
Subdirectories within this drop folder are not supported.
To maintain multiple directories, configure a different input for each directory.
To configure the Custom CSV Feed:
Visit SETUP > Inputs > Feeds in the mParticle UI and click the Add Feed Input button, then select Custom CSV Feed from the list.
If you’ve already added the Custom CSV Feed, it won’t show up in the list. Scroll through the list of feeds until you see Custom CSV Feed, and then click the large plus sign in the gray bar to create a new feed. You need one feed for each different event type.
Enter the following values:
Configuration Name: enter a name that makes this feed easy to recognize in your list of feeds.
Custom Event Name: if you are importing a custom event, enter the name that will be used for the custom event.
Custom Event T",16,guides_csv_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,"ype: if you entered a custom event name, select the event type.
Custom Manifest: if you are using a custom manifest, paste it in the text box provided.
Expect Encrypted Files: if you will import a PGP/GPG-encrypted file, select this option.
After you complete the connection configuration, click Issue SFTP Details. mParticle displays your hostname and path for mParticle’s SFTP server.
4. Drop CSV files on the SFTP server
Connect to the mParticle SFTP server using the credentials provided. Once you have connected, the mParticle creates the drop folder. If you don’t see one, create a folder named drop.
Create a new folder inside the drop folder, and name it using the pathname provided in the mParticle UI as shown in the previous section. For example, based on the previous example, the folder path and name is sftp.mparticle.com:4422:drop/us1-123456789123456789/. Hint: Verify that there are no trailing spaces in the name.
Use your credentials to upload your CSV files to mParticle’s SFTP ser",17,guides_csv_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/csv/,"ver, using the correct path and folder name from the previous step.
Files on the SFTP location are added to the processing queue nearly immediately.
Depending on file count and file size, a backlog may develop. You can observe how much data has been processed using Data Master and your outbound connections. There is no notification of processing progress or completion.
CSV File Reference provides more information about processing behavior and the advanced techniques of working with custom manifests or encrypted files.Was this page helpful?YesNoLast Updated: February 27, 2025© 2025 mParticle, Inc.

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/pinterest/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/pinterest/audience,"nceZendeskEventFeedQuadratic LabsEventZ2A DigitalEventAudienceQualtricsEventAudiencePinterest - Reach people who are using Pinterest to discover and plan the things they want to do in the future.
Using the Ads API, businesses on Pinterest manage, scale and optimize their Promoted Pins.
Prerequisites
In order to enable mParticle’s integration with Pinterest, you need to have a business account with Pinterest, and the account credentials for the Pinterest account.
The integration activation process in Audience Manager will prompt you to log into your Pinterest account, and once authorized, mParticle will automatically retrieve the credentials that it needs to forward audiences to Pinterest.
If you are not working with a Pinterest Marketing Developer Partner, contact advertiser-data-onboarders@pinterest.com and CC your Pinterest account team requesting access to the Pinterest API.
Data Processing Notes
Timing - An audience named <Audience Name>-EMAIL and <Audience Name>-MAID will be avail",14,integrations_pinterest_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/pinterest/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/pinterest/audience,"able in Pinterest upon activating a subscription in mParticle, however it may take up to 24 hours before the size of the audience is shown in Pinterest.
Minimum - An audience is selectable for targeting in Pinterest as long as it has a minimum of 100 users.
If an audience is selected while in the processing state, and later is calculated to be less than 100 users, the campaign will not serve.
Maximum - There is a limit of 300 million users in an audience.
This is a count of the raw number of records that mParticle has sent to Pinterest.
If an audience reaches this limit, mParticle will no longer send user updates to Pinterest.
Additional Notes - If an email or device ID is added to an audience, and is not currently a Pinterest user, the user will not be added to the audience even if the user later becomes a Pinterest user.
User Identity Mapping
When forwarding audience data to Pinterest, mParticle will send SHA-1 hash of IDFAs, Google Advertising IDs and Emails based on the values of t",15,integrations_pinterest_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/pinterest/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/pinterest/audience,"he Connection Settings.
Upload Frequency
The Pinterest Audience Integration uses Bulk Forwarding. Bulk Forwarding means that, instead of uploading updates to an audience in real time, mParticle compiles updates into a queue until either a given amount of time has passed since the last upload, or until a certain number of updates are waiting to be sent.
By default, mParticle uploads to Pinterest whenever at least one of the following conditions is met:
3 hours have passed since the last update.
At least 100000 messages are in the queue.
Upload frequency can sometimes be adjusted. Reach out to your mParticle Customer Success Manager if you need to discuss upload frequency.
Deleting an Audience
mParticle doesn’t delete the downstream audience when you delete an audience in mParticle.

mParticle provides several SDKs and APIs allowing you to collect data from a variety of sources, like a mobile app, web app, or data feeds from other SaaS providers.
You can collect two types of data with mParticle:
Event data: data that describes what your users are doing
User data: data that describes who your users are
Learn how",9,developers_quickstart_ios.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/ios,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/ios," to integrate the iOS SDK from start to finish
To demonstrate how mParticle works, you will learn how to track basic event data like page views and product purchases in a mobile app using the mParticle iOS SDK. Then, you will learn how to send that data to a webhook. You will also learn how to manage your data quality by creating a data plan.
mParticle provides thirteen SDKs for specific platforms like web, iOS, and Android, in addition to several APIs. mParticle also provides over 250 integrations with data warehouse, analytics, and marketing automation tools.
To keep your first steps with mParticle quick and easy, this tutorial uses the iOS SDK and a sample ecommerce app called The Higgs Shop.
This is a technical tutorial for developers. If you aren’t a developer, you can find a general introduction to mParticle in the Platform Guide.
About the iOS SDK
mParticle’s iOS SDK supports both mobile iOS and tvOS devices.
By initializing the iOS SDK in your app, you gain access to useful met",10,developers_quickstart_ios.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/ios,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/ios,"hods you can call in your app’s code to send events and user data to mParticle.
Prerequisites
Access to an mParticle instance
In order to begin sending data from your app to mParticle, you need access to an mParticle account and an API key.
Download the mParticle sample app
This tutorial demonstrates how mParticle works using The Higgs Shop, a sample iOS application written in the Swift programming language.
Open your terminal or command prompt, and clone the iOS sample app repository on GitHub.
Open the sample app in Xcode
If you don’t already have Xcode installed on your computer, download and install the correction version for your OS now.
Navigate to your cloned directory of the iOS sample app and open HiggsShopSampleApp.xcodeproj in Xcode.
Any missing dependencies will be automatically updated by the Swift Package Manager in Xcode.
Click the Run icon in the toolbar to ensure that you can successfully build the sample app.
Since you haven’t added your API key and secret to the samp",11,developers_quickstart_ios.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/ios,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/ios,"le app yet, you will receive a warning message. You will generate and add your API key and secret in the next step.
For now, ignore the API key warning that appears. In the next step, you will create and add your API key and secret before restarting the sample app.

The purpose of this guide is to walk you through the basic steps of setting up mParticle in your app, unlocking core functionality, and troubleshooting common issues. Along the way, you’ll cover some important concepts you need to understand to be successful with mParticle.
This is not a complete guide to all of mParticle’s features and capabilities. If you already know your way around mParticle and you’re looking for in-depth docs, head to our Developers or Guides sections.
Most of this guide ",9,guides_getting-started_create-an-input_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/,"is aimed at users of the mParticle Dashboard, but to follow along with the tutorials, you will need to set up the mParticle SDK in your iOS, Android or web app, so you may need support from a developer to complete some steps.
Examples
The tutorials in this guide follow the process of setting up mParticle in the mPTravel app: a mobile and web app that sells luxury travel packages to its users.
Later on in this guide, you’ll learn about sending data from mParticle to some of our many integration partners. As examples, the tutorials use services which are simple to set up and verify, and which offer a free account tier, so that you will be able follow the examples exactly if you wish. However, mParticle is agnostic about which integrations you choose and you can follow the same basic steps from this guide to implement any of our integrations.
Inputs and Outputs
One of the key functions of mParticle is to receive your data from wherever it originates, and send it wherever it needs to go. T",10,guides_getting-started_create-an-input_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/,"he sources of your data are inputs and the service or app where it is forwarded are outputs. A connection is a combination of an input and output.
Inputs include:
Apps or services built on any platform we support, such as iOS, Android, or Web. You can view the full list in SETUP > Inputs in the PLATFORMS tab.
Data feeds of any other data you want to send into mParticle. This could be data you have collected yourself or from a feed partner. Once configured, feed inputs are listed in SETUP > Inputs on the FEEDS tab.
Outputs may be configured for events, audiences, cookie syncs, or data subject requests depending on what the output supports. You can see the list of configured outputs in SETUP > Outputs or SETUP > Data Warehouses. Outputs include:
Analytics partners such as Indicative
Advertising partners such as Facebook
In-app messaging partners such as Braze
Data Warehouse partners, such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake
To get started with mParticle, you need some data,",11,guides_getting-started_create-an-input_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/," which means you need to create at least one input.
Create Access Credentials
The first thing you need to do is to to create a set of access credentials that will allow a client-side SDK or a server-side application to forward data to this workspace.
Login to your mParticle account. If you’re just getting started, your first workspace is created for you. The first screen you see is an overview of activity in the workspace. Since you haven’t yet sent any data, there’s nothing to report, so far.
Navigate to Setup > Inputs in the left column. Here you can see each platform type accepted by mParticle. Different platforms are associated with different sets of metadata, such as device identifiers, and most outputs only accept data from a limited set of platforms, so it is important to select the right platform. To capture data from your native Android app, choose Android. Just click the + next to your chosen platform.
Click Issue Keys.
Copy and save the generated Key and Secret.
About Access",12,guides_getting-started_create-an-input_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/," Credentials
mParticle labels the credentials you create for an integration the key and secret, but they are not exactly like an API key and secret, since you embed these credentials in the app. However, this is not the security risk that exposing API credentials would be:
The client-side key and secret can’t read data from the system.
You can block bad data to stop any traffic that doesn’t match the data you expect as defined in your schema.
Most anonymous client-server architectures, including Adobe, Braze, Firebase, Google Analytics, and Segment don’t have per-session or per-instance credentials, nor does mParticle.
Install and Initialize an mParticle SDK
You need a developer to help you install and initialize an SDK. See the Getting Started guides for the iOS, Android or Javascript SDKs to get set up before continuing.
Verify: Look for Incoming Data in the Live Stream
Navigate to Activity > Live Stream in the left column. The Live Stream lets you inspect all incoming data from your",13,guides_getting-started_create-an-input_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/," development environments. It’s an easy way to check that you have correctly initialized mParticle in your app. When you first open up the Live Stream, it will be empty, as we haven’t yet started sending data.
Start up a development build of your app (get a developer to help you if necessary). The mParticle SDKs automatically collect and forward data about installs and user sessions, so just by opening a development build of your app, you should start to see data in the Live Stream.
Advanced Platform Configuration Settings
For the iOS, Android, tvOS, and Web platforms, some advanced configuration settings are available. To change these settings, navigate to Setup > Inputs in the left column and select either iOS, Android, tvOS, or Web from the list of platforms.
Expand the Advanced Settings by clicking the + icon.
Restrict Device ID by Limit Ad Tracking
iOS, Android, and tvOS (Apple TV) devices allow users to limit the collection of advertising IDs. Advertising IDs are unique identifie",14,guides_getting-started_create-an-input_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/,"rs you may use to associate event and user data with a specific device. For both iOS and Android devices, if a user has not provided explicit consent to share their device’s advertising ID, then the value of that ID is set to an all-zero value.
By checking Restrict Device ID by Limit Ad Tracking, mParticle will not collect advertising IDs from users who have enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device.
Remember, mParticle will collect advertising IDs for both iOS and Android devices, regardless of whether or not a user has enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device. However, the IDs collected from users who have opted out will be all-zero values.
Following are descriptions of Apple and Google’s policies for device advertising IDs:
iOS Advertising IDs
After the release of iOS 14.5, Apple introduced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, which requires app developers to request users’ explicit consent to share their advertising IDs. If a user of your app has ",15,guides_getting-started_create-an-input_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/,"not provided this consent, Apple’s advertising ID (IDFA) will be set to all an all-zero value: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. Read more about Apple advertising identifiers in their documentation.
For more information about the ATT framework, visit the iOS 14 Guide.
Android Advertising IDs
Google allows Android users to opt out from sharing their devices’ advertising IDs. Similar to Apple’s policy, Google will set a user’s advertising ID (GAID or AAID) to an all-zero value if that user has opted out from sharing their ID. Read more about Google’s advertising identifiers in their documentation.
Collect Integration-Specific Identifiers
The Web SDK can collect integration-specific identifiers to enrich the user data forwarded to your connected outputs.
When Collect Integration-Specific Identifiers is checked, these integration-specific identifiers are collected and used to enrich your user data to help optimize the match rate of your audiences in downstream tools. Currently, these i",16,guides_getting-started_create-an-input_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/,"dentifiers include Facebook’s fbc and fbp fields.

Troubleshoot
If you don’t see data appearing in the Live Stream within the first few minutes after opening a development build:
Check that you have copied your Key and Secret correctly
Check that you have properly included the mParticle SDK in your project and it is correctly initialized. The necessary steps will differ depending on the platform. Check our iOS, Android and Web docs for more.

This data feeds both traditional segmentation and our predictive models. You can also enrich that data stream with other sources like CRM data or purchase data from other channels. Comprehensive data capture improves both immediate segmentation and predictive accuracy.

Examples
Use audiences to create sophisticated segments powered by both rules and machine learning.
Drive User Engagement Through Intelligent Segmentation
Let’s say you want to target users who installed your app to increase their engagement. There are two approaches to accomplishing this using Audiences:
Rules-based: Taking this strategy, you would use audience criteria to build a customer segment that aligns with your target characteristics, like users who installed your app in the last 72 hours with fewer than three sessions.
AI-powered: Using a predictive approach, you c",10,guides_personalization_audiences_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/audiences/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/audiences/,"ould simply define your business goal, then let Predictive Attributes to perform a comprehensive analysis of user data to predict which new users are most likely to take the engagement action you have defined. Once the Predictive Attribute has been generated, you could use it as an audience criteria to select users who are statistically most likely to engage with your app.
No matter which approach you take, you can easily forward your audience to push notification and email partners.
Once these audience connections are established, mParticle instantiates a corresponding audiences both partners.
No coding is necessary.
Drive app downloads
Let’s say you want to find more users like your currently highly engaged users and run an app download campaign in Facebook against that target audience. You start by defining your highly engaged users, using whatever criteria is important to you: lifetime value metrics, session activity, event activity, or any other data points you capture.
Once your ",11,guides_personalization_audiences_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/audiences/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/audiences/,"audience is defined, configure the Facebook integration and corresponding custom audiences in your Facebook account.
From there you can leverage the custom audiences like any other custom audience in Facebook.
Because we want to target users that look like our highly engaged users, we will create a Facebook lookalike audience from our highly engaged user audience and run a Facebook app install campaign that targets that lookalike audience.Was this page helpful?YesNoLast Updated: February 27, 2025© 2025 mParticle, Inc.

Before you start this activity, you should have already:
Created an input.
Data in mParticle
mParticle collects two important kinds of data:
Event data
Event data is about actions taken by a user in your app. Some events are collected automatically by mParticle’s native SDKs. These include the Session Start events you saw in the Live stream when you first set up your input. Other events need to be captured by writing code in your app",9,guides_getting-started_start-capturing-data_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/start-capturing-data/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/start-capturing-data/,". Of these, the most significant are:
Screen/Page Views - keep track of where a user is in your app
Custom Events - track any actions the user might take in your app, such as clicking a button or watching a video.
Commerce Events - track purchases and other product-related activity.
User data
mParticle also captures data about your user, including their identities, information about the device they are using and any custom attributes you set. As with event data, some user data, such as information about the devices they use, is captured automatically by mParticle’s native SDKs. Two important types of user data must be captured by writing code in your app:
User identities are unique identifiers for your user, like an email address or customer ID. These are different from the device identities collected automatically by the SDKs, which don’t identify an individual person but a particular cell phone, browser session, or some other device. User identities help mParticle keep track of uniqu",10,guides_getting-started_start-capturing-data_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/start-capturing-data/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/start-capturing-data/,"e users of your app and allow you to track a user’s activity over time and across different devices. To learn a lot more about user and device identities, read our IDSync guide. For now, you just need to know that a user identity is a way of identifying a person, independently of the device they are currently using.
User Attributes are key-value pairs that can store any custom data about your user. The value of a user attribute can be:
A string
A number
A list
A boolean value (true or false)
null - attributes with a null value function as ‘tags’, and can be used to sort your users into categories.
Capture User and Event Data
To start capturing data you will need to go back to your app code. In the previous step you should have installed and initialized the mParticle SDK in at least one of your app platforms. This means you’re already set up to capture Session Start and Session End events, as well as basic data about the device. Grab a friendly developer again, if you need one, and try ",11,guides_getting-started_start-capturing-data_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/start-capturing-data/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/start-capturing-data/,"to add some additional user and event data to your implementation. Here are a few things you might try, with links to the appropriate developer docs:
Add a Customer ID or Email Address for a user.Android / iOS / Web
Create a custom user attribute that tells you something about a user. For example: status: ""premium"".Android / iOS / Web
Create a page or screen view event that captures the name of a page or screen being viewed. Android / iOS / Web
Create a custom event to track a user action in your app. Include some custom attributes. For example, the mPTravel app sends a custom event when a user views one of its content videos. The event is called “Play Video” and it has two custom attributes: the category of content, and the travel destination the video promotes. Later on, you’ll see how events like these can be used to target custom messaging. Android / iOS / Web
Create a purchase event - track a purchase using mParticle’s commerce APIs. Android / iOS / Web
Verify: Look for incoming d",12,guides_getting-started_start-capturing-data_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/start-capturing-data/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/start-capturing-data/,"ata in the Live Stream
Once you’ve added code to your app to start collecting some basic data, start up a development build of your app again and trigger some events. Have another look at the Live Stream. You should start to see new event batches, with the individual events you have added to your app.
Troubleshoot
If you have at least some data in your Live Stream, such as the session start and session end messages generated in the previous step, but your screen views, custom events or purchases aren’t showing, it’s likely that there is an issue with your app code.
Check that your code is correctly formed, and that the methods which send events to mParticle are actually triggered by user activity in your app.
Review your development environment’s logs. These will show when an event is sent to mParticle.
Next steps
Excellent, you’ve started collecting real custom datapoints from your app. At this point you might want to take a quick break to:

AMP includes an amp-analytics element that allows you to track user interactions with AMP pages.
To learn more about analytics for AMP pages see the amp-analytics reference. For general information about AMP see What Is AMP? on the Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project site.
Supported user interactions
amp-analytics is an extended component and must be explicitly included into the document as a custom element to use it. ",9,developers_client-sdks_amp_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/amp/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/amp/getting-started/,"To add AMP analytics functionality to your page:
Include this script in the <head>, before the AMP JS library:

</amp-analytics>
Add the amp-analytics element to the body of your page and set the type attribute of the amp-analytics element to mparticle.
It is recommended to include an id attribute so that you can easily identify each amp-analytics element (e.g. debugging).
The following trigger request values are supported for the mParticle configuration:
pageview for page tracking
app events for event tracking
AMP Page tracking
Page tracking allows you to measure the number of views you had for a particular page on your website.
Pageview hits can be sent by setting the trigger request value to pageview.

The property apiKey `Your mParticle API Key` should be replaced with the API Key of your app as configured in mParticle App Settings in the code snippet and the rest of the examples.
The web API Key should be used.
You can set key-value pairs for the following pageview fields in the vars attribute of the trigger.

AMP Event tracking
Events are user interactions with content that can be tracked independently from a web page or a screen load.
Event hits can be sent by setting the trigger request value to event and providing additional event properties.

This SDK is stateless and will only send the data that you populate, whereas our mobile SDKs will automatically collect app and device information, session events, install events, and maintain persistence.

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/node/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/node/," integrations.
Model Overview
Batch
All data sent via the SDK must be encapsulated in a Batch object. Each Batch is associated with a single user. Batch objects must be associated with an environment (production or development) to properly silo your testing and production data.
var batch = new mParticle.Batch(mParticle.Batch.Environment.development);
User Identities
Most use-cases require that data be associated with a user identity, for example:
If you’re also sending data to mParticle via our mobile SDKs, set a customer ID both via the mobile SDKs and this SDK so that mParticle can correctly associate data with each user.
Several marketing automation and audience integrations are powered by email.
var user_identities = new mParticle.UserIdentities();
user_identities.customerid = '123456'
batch.user_identities = user_identities;
Device Information
The DeviceInformation object describes a mobile device that should be associated with this batch. Crucially, it exposes properties for devi",10,developers_server-sdks_node_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/node/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/node/,"ce identities (Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID) which are required for nearly all mParticle Audience integrations.
var device_info = new mParticle.DeviceInformation();
// set any IDs that you have for this user
device_info.ios_advertising_id = '07d2ebaa-e956-407e-a1e6-f05f871bf4e2';
device_info.android_advertising_id = 'a26f9736-c262-47ea-988b-0b0504cee874';
batch.device_info = device_info;
User Attributes
The mParticle audience platform can be powered by only sending a combination of user attributes, used to describe segments of users, and device identities/user identities used to then target those users.
// arbitrary example allowing you to create a segment of users trial users
batch.user_attributes = {'Account type': 'trial', 'TrialEndDate':'2016-12-01'};
Events
Events are central to many of mParticle’s integrations; analytics integrations typically require events, and you can create mParticle Audiences based on the recency and frequency of different events. All events should b",11,developers_server-sdks_node_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/node/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/node/,"e associated with a timestamp reflecting when they actually occurred, otherwise they will be assigned a timestamp when mParticle receives them.
AppEvent
App Events represent specific actions that a user has taken in your app. At minimum they require a name and a type, but can also be associate with a free-form dictionary of key/value pairs.
var event = new mParticle.AppEvent(mParticle.AppEvent.CustomEventType.navigation,
'Hello World');
event.custom_attributes = { foo: 'bar' };
batch.addEvent(event);
CommerceEvent
The CommerceEvent is central to mParticle’s eCommerce measurement. CommerceEvents can contain many data points but it’s important to understand that there are 3 core variations:
Product-based: used to measure measured data points associated with one or more products
Promotion-based: used to measure data points associated with internal promotions or campaigns
Impression-based: used to measure interactions with impressions of products and product-listings
// 1. Create the produ",12,developers_server-sdks_node_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/node/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/node/,"ct and add any product attributes
var product = new mParticle.Product();
product.name = 'Example Product';
product.id = 'sample-sku';
product.price = 19.99;
// Optional custom attributes for the product can be added as key/value string pairs within a customAttributes object
product.customAttributes = {
""on-sale"": ""true"",
""referbished"": ""false""
};
// 2. Summarize the purchase of the product in a ProductAction object, passing in the product object created in step 1
var product_action = new mParticle.ProductAction('purchase');
product_action.products = [product];
product_action.tax_amount = 1.50;
product_action.total_amount = 21.49;
// 3. Log the purchase event using CommerceEvent
var commerce_event = new mParticle.CommerceEvent();
commerce_event.product_action = product_action;
commerce_event.timestamp_unixtime_ms = 1484322995852; // Replace with time of transaction
batch.addEvent(commerce_event);
Session Events
The SessionStartEvent and SessionEndEvent should be used to describe the det",13,developers_server-sdks_node_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/node/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/node/,"ails of user session such as its length, which is a common metric used in many mParticle integrations. Additonally, length, recency, and frequency of sessions are powerful data-points by which an mParticle audience can be defined.
var session_start = new mParticle.SessionStartEvent();
session_start.session_id = 12345678;
session_start.timestamp_unixtime_ms = example_timestamp;
session_end = new mParticle.SessionEndEvent();
session_end.session_id = session_start.session_id; // it's mandatory that these match
session_end.session_duration_ms = example_duration;
session_end.timestamp_unixtime_ms = example_timestamp + example_duration;
batch.events = [session_start, session_end];
Consent State
To conform to the ever growing global regulations on data privacy, mParticle supports Data Privacy Controls.
This is initially configured in the dashboard and is attached via a batch’s consent_state.
CCPA
var ccpa_consent_state = new mParticle.CCPAConsentState();
ccpa_consent_state.document = 'documen",14,developers_server-sdks_node_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/node/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/node/,"t_agreement.v3';
ccpa_consent_state.consented = true;
ccpa_consent_state.timestamp_unixtime_ms = Date.now();
ccpa_consent_state.location = 'mparticle.test/signup';
ccpa_consent_state.hardware_id = 'IDFA:a5d96n32-224a-3b11-1088-a202695bc710';
var consent_state = new mParticle.ConsentState();
consent_state.ccpa = { data_sale_opt_out: ccpa_consent_state };
batch.consent_state = consent_state;
GDPR
var gdpr_consent_state = new mParticle.GDPRConsentState();
gdpr_consent_state.document = 'document_agreement.v2';
gdpr_consent_state.consented = true;
gdpr_consent_state.timestamp_unixtime_ms = Date.now();
gdpr_consent_state.location = 'dtmgbank.com/signup';
gdpr_consent_state.hardware_id = 'IDFA:a5d934n0-232f-4afc-2e9a-3832d95zc702';
var consent_state = new mParticle.ConsentState();
consent_state.gdpr = { 'My Purpose': gdpr_consent_state };
batch.consent_state = consent_state;
In this example, 'My Purpose' should match the Consent Purpose defined in your GDPR Settings
HTTP Client Usage
The SDK ",15,developers_server-sdks_node_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/node/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/node/,"provides an interface to the mParticle HTTP API by way of the EventsApi class.
Configuration
At minimum, the EventsApi must be initialized with a Configuration object, containing an mParticle key and secret. You can find your mParticle key and secret by navigating to the Apps section of the mParticle platform UI.
You must associate your data with the correct key and secret. If your app is multi-platform, for example, be sure to send your Android data to your Android key/secret, and your iOS data to your iOS key/secret.
var api = new mParticle.EventsApi(new mParticle.Configuration(
'REPLACE WITH API KEY',
'REPLACE WITH API SECRET'));
Uploading Data
The EventsAPI class exposes two interfaces:
bulkUploadEvents - Accepts up to 100 Batch objects for up to 100 users.
uploadEvents - Accepts a single Batch object for a single user
var batch = new mParticle.Batch(mParticle.Batch.Environment.development);

This feature is not prescriptive and there is no single way to implement consent or opt-out. Instead, mParticle gives you a simple, standard technique for storing and applying consent and opt-out choices. Consent state powers both GDPR consent and CCPA data sale opt-out.
This guide introduces you to mParticle’s data privacy control functionality and shows you how to collect an individual’s consent an",9,guides_data-privacy-controls.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,"d apply it to your data flows.
Common uses of data privacy controls
Data privacy controls are flexible and customizable, allowing you to build any data flow or consent-based logic you need.
Use mParticle’s data privacy controls to help comply with CCPA’s “do not sell my data” requirement by collecting users who opt-out and blocking those users’ data from flowing to any ‘data sale’ output by:
Recording a CCPA data sale opt-out as a user consent (more information below)
Identify which outputs count as ‘data sale’ and apply the below forwarding rule to them
Applying a forwarding rule of: Do not forward if CCPA Data sale opt out is present
GDPR defines consent as one method of lawful data processing. One common setup is to:
Define a processing purpose of ‘marketing’
Prompt users for affirmative consent for ‘marketing’
Identify which outputs would perform ‘analytics’ processing
Apply a forwarding rule of: Only forward user data if GDPR Consent for ‘marketing’ is true
Data privacy and the mP",10,guides_data-privacy-controls.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,"article platform
Once enabled and configured, data privacy work with the mParticle platform to ingest and pass on consent state:
Define categories of data collection called consent purposes.
Store the consent state in a user’s profile.
Control data flow based on stored consent.
Send user consent state to your integrations (outputs).
Enabling data privacy controls
Data privacy controls save user consent decisions and applies them to data flows.
Enable GDPR and/or CCPA compliance features on your workspace from Workspace Settings > Workspace > Regulation.
For GDPR, create a set of purposes from Privacy > Privacy Settings in the dashboard.
Once a purpose has been added it cannot be removed.
A purpose defines the scope of data collection and processing to which the user may consent. GDPR recognizes several different purposes for data collection including the possibility of a user consenting to some purposes of data collection but not others. mParticle does not limit you to a specific set o",11,guides_data-privacy-controls.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,"f purposes, but rather lets you define your own purposes when you set up a workspace.
For CCPA, once it is enabled in your workspace, the purpose data_sale_opt_out is automatically created. The SDKs and mParticle UIs facilitate using this purpose, so you don’t need to hardcode it anywhere.
Consent properties
The mParticle format for a single record of a user decision on a privacy prompt, .consent, is our consent_state object. This is used for both GDPR-style opt-in consent and for CCPA-style opt-out.
For each user or workspace, consent state can be stored for each possible combination of regulation and purpose. For each purpose, the following fields are supported.
All fields are optional, except consented, timestamp_unixtime_ms, regulation and purpose. The regulation and purpose fields are built into the structure. Be sure to include your privacy and compliance experts when deciding how to implement optional fields.

For detailed definitions of how to report consent state, review the sections of our API and SDK references that cover data privacy controls:
Web SDK
iOS SDK
Android SDK
AMP SDK
HTTP API
Additionally, our integration with OneTrust allows you to ingest customer consent states into mParticle.
Using consent state
User profiles
Consent state is maintained per person on the User Profile using the structure defined above.
For testing consent, you can use User Activity View to check that a consent was recorded correctly. Here is an example of how CCPA data sale opt-out will appear:
Audien",15,guides_data-privacy-controls.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,"ces
Consent state can be used to create conditions in the Audience Builder to check a users’ consent state as a requirement for audience inclusion or exclusion.
For example, for CCPA you may want to include only users who have NOT opted out of data sale, by adding a criteria like this:
For GDPR, you may want to include only users that have an opt-in consent for a given purpose, shown here as ‘Advertising’:
Connections and forwarding rules
Consent state can be used to create forwarding rules that selectively filter data based on a users consent state, in real time and per-person.
For example, you can choose to only forward data from users who have given consent for a particular purpose.
For CCPA, you may want a forwarding rule to apply a data sale opt-out. In this example, users’ who have a consent state of true for the CCPA purpose of data_sale_opt_out will NOT have their data forwarded (if the consent state is missing or false for that purpose, data will flow):
For GDPR, you may want ",16,guides_data-privacy-controls.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,"a forwarding rule to only send data when a single purpose is consented:
Kits and forwarding rules
If you set up a Forwarding Rule for an embedded kit integration, the iOS and Android SDKs will check consent status for the user on initialization. If the rule condition fails, the kit will not be initialized. Note that kits are only initialized when a session begins or on user change, so if consent status changes in the course of a session, while mParticle will immediately stop forwarding data to the kit, it is possible that an embedded kit may remain active and independently forwarding data to a partner from the client until the session ends.
Forwarding consent state to partners
When the consent state of a profile changes, that change can be communicated to mParticle event integrations. If the consent_state object on an incoming event batch contains changes from the existing profile, mParticle adds a ‘system notification’ to the batch for each consent state change before the batch is sen",17,guides_data-privacy-controls.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,"t to incoming forwarders. This notification contains the full old and new consent state objects:
""system_notifications"": [

}
},
""type"": ""gdpr_change""
}
]
There are currently two ways that consent state changes are forwarded to mParticle event integrations:
Some partners accept raw event batch data from mParticle, mostly for data storage or custom analytics use cases. For these partners, mParticle will forward the ‘system_notifications’ object with each relevant event batch. For",18,guides_data-privacy-controls.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,"warding of system notifications can be turned off with a user setting. Integrations that can currently receive the system notifications object include:
Amazon Kinesis
Amazon S3
Amazon SNS
Amazon SQS
Google Pub/Sub
Google Cloud Storage
Microsoft Azure Event Hubs
Slack
Webhook
mParticle is working with other partners to support forwarding consent state changes as a Custom Event. These events contain the new consent state information as custom attributes, a custom event type of ""Consent"", and an event name of ""Consent Given"" or ""Consent Rejected"". These consent events are forwarded to supporting partners as standard custom events.

}
Partners that currently accept these custom consent state events include:
Amplitude
Snowplow
Mixpanel
Google Analytics
Salesforce DMP
“GDPR Consent Change” is
listed as a data type in the Integrations directory and we will update this list as more partners add support. Please reach out to your success manager if you would like to distribute consent to an additional partner.
Data subject requests
mParticle helps you respond to data subject requests as mandated by the GDPR and CCPA regulations.
You can search for integrations that support data subject requests in the Integrations page. Search on category Data Subject Request.
Ingest GPC signals
The California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) and the upcoming CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act) require that users can signal their privacy choices. In support of that requirement, you can ingest Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals with mParticle.
Browsers append the GPC signal to HTTP requests and make it queryab",20,guides_data-privacy-controls.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls,"le via the DOM. This signal is designed to convey a person’s request to websites and services to not sell or share their personal information with third parties, per the Global Privacy Control specification. This opt-out is at the browser level, allowing users to turn on the GPC signal for all or specific websites.
The workflow for ingesting and forwarding GPC signals via SDK or Events API:
Sample code for GPC
This sample code show two options: mapping to a GDPR purpose and mapping to a user attribute.

var gpcSignal = navigator.globalPrivacyControl;
/*

Understanding Data Points and Data Plans
For every mParticle workspace, you may have many data plans.
Every data plan contains one or more data plan versions.
Each data plan version contains data points that you have defined.
A data point is a unit of data collected by mParticle. Data points represent Events such as Custom Events or Screen Views, or User attributes such as Customer Id or Email.
Each data point includes criteria used to select the data point from an incoming data stream, and a definition called a schema that validates the contents of the data point. You can view data points in all three Data Master tools: Catalog, Live Stream, and Data Plan.
For example, here is a view of the Play Video data point in Catalog:

Developers who need to validate data against a schema and get live feedback on invalid data points during QA.
Product managers who need better control over data collection and federation throughout their tech stack.
Marketers who need to prevent bad data from entering a downstream partner.
Privacy teams who need more safeguards against bad data entering the tech stack.
Data governance teams who need to collaborate more seamlessly on data ",9,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,"requirements and architecture.
A data plan is a codified set of expectations about the extent and shape of your data collected with mParticle. A plan contains the following elements:
Name: a descriptive label for the plan. Keep in mind several teams may reference this name and share the plan. Plans may be renamed after they are created.
ID: a URL-safe slug. This value never changes and is automatically generated based on the original plan name. The ID is used by your teams to refer to the plan in their code when they send data into mParticle.
Version (Optional): an integer value. You can create new versions of a plan as you evolve your schema. When the version is omitted the latest active version in an environment is chosen.
Description (Optional): an optional freeform field to describe the plan.
Data Points: each data point contains an event, user attributes, or user identities. You define these for each type of data you expect to receive.
You create and update data plans using the mP",10,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,"article user interface (UI), a Data Plan Builder (Google Sheet) or the Data Planning API.
Use the mParticle UI for simple plans (with few repeating attributes across events).
Use the Data Plan Builder for complex plans with many repeating event attribute across events.
Use the Data Planning API instead of the mParticle UI if you:
Store data plans in source code, and use your own SDLC and approval processes to define your data model.
Integrate mParticle’s suite of Data Planning tools to perform compile-time and runtime data quality verification.
Depending on your goals, create a single plan or multiple plans. You decide whether all of your feeds and inputs share the same plan, or if you create a unique plan for every individual client-side and server-side input. Two common scenarios indicate a need for multiple plans:
Your web app(s) may have slight variations to data collection as compared to your mobile app(s).
You have a specific server-side feed that collects a different set of data",11,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/," from your client-side inputs. You may wish to ensure that each feed sticks only to its intended data points.
Limits
Similar to our event limit for workspaces, data plans support up to 1,000 data points.
Managing plans with more than 400 data points in the UI can become unwieldy. Manage larger plans outside the UI, either via a Data Plan Builder or the Data Planning API.
You can block data only for unplanned violations: events or attributes with names that diverge from the schema defined in a data plan.
Prerequisites
Although most of the data planning steps can be completed in the Data Plan UI, Step 3 requires a small code change. You must have developer support for the following:
Adding a small piece of code to the client SDK on each initialization.
For the Events API, adding a small piece of code to each request body.

Getting Started
To create and implement a data plan:
Create a data plan that defines your expectations for incoming data. You can choose one of four different ways to create your plan:
If this is your first time experimenting with data plans, and you are unfamiliar with your data structure, start with a template to explore the basics of data points (events and attributes) and data validation.
If you don’t have any data in mParticle yet, but understand your data structure and are ready to implement your first data plan, use Data Plan Builder. This tool is a Google Sheet that provides step-by-step guidance to create a data plan and convert it into JSON in order to upload it to mParticle. Data Plan Builder uses either a generic template or an industry-specific template.
If you already have data in mParticle, import data from the mParticle Catalo",13,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,"g, or from another data plan or a JSON file.
Want to start from scratch? You can start with a completely empty plan and import your data later.
You can easily create, modify, and delete plans, so feel free to experiment.
Activate your plan, so it is ready to validate incoming data.
Tag your incoming data so that it is validated against the plan. You’ll need a developer to complete this step.
Monitor your event stream to measure and continuously improve the quality of your data. To monitor data, review violations reports, and then fix your implementation or adjust your data plan.
Update your data plan as you learn more about the data you collect, or as it changes over time. You can also move plans from one environment to another.
Block unplanned data from being stored in mParticle and forwarded to downstream systems.

}
Once you have the JSON from Data Plan Builder, paste it into the Data Plan import window (as explained in Step 1.3 below), or store the file and upload it using the Data Planning API.
Step 1: Create Your Plan
To create a plan:
In the mParticle UI, select Data Master > Plans > Create Plan.
Choose how you will import data points, using the instructions in the dialog to pick the most suitable method.
Note:
You can move data plans between various mParticle workspaces and accounts by downloading and uploading JSON formatted plans.
When updating or uploading a data plan by copying and pasting JSON (as when using the Data Plan Builder) you must update the version description separately in the mParticle UI.
Step 2: Activate Your Plan
To start verifying incoming data against your plan, you first need to activate it. To do this, click the Activate button on your data plan’s home screen. Then in the Activate modal, use the",17,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/," Status dropdown to select the environment in which you want to activate your data plan (dev or prod). (You also have the option to save the plan as a draft to return to later.)
Now that your plan is active, you need to ensure that incoming data is tagged with your plan’s id. Continue to the next step to learn how.
Step 3: Validate Incoming Data with Your Plan
Before mParticle validates incoming data against the plan, the data must be tagged with a plan ID, an environment, and optionally a plan version. This is the step that requires a small code change, as mentioned in Prerequisites.
Gather the Required Information
Plan ID: This is the “slugified” form of your data plan name. You can find it during plan creation, and on the plan listing page.
Plan Version (optional): The plan version that the data should conform to. If omitted, mParticle uses the latest active version for your environment.
Environment (development or production): The environment of your data. mParticle uses this value",18,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/," to look for plans that are activated in the given environment.
To find your plan ID, navigate to the plan listing page. In the following image, fintech_template is the plan ID and should be used in the code snippets below:
Add the Required Information to All Batches Sent to mParticle
Include the plan ID and environment in all batches sent to mParticle.
For client-side SDKs, you must provide this metadata on initialization of the SDK.
For the Events API, you must include it in every request body.
In addition to plan ID, you can optionally add a plan version, which pins your validation to a specific version. If the plan version is omitted, mParticle will choose the latest version active in a given environment.
Example Code in Four Languages
You can cut and paste the following example code in either JSON, Swift, Kotlin, or JavaScript for your developer to implement:
JSONSwiftKotlinJavascript
{
""context"": {
""data_plan"": {
""plan_id"": ""mobile_data_plan"",
""plan_version"": 2
}
},
""environment""",19,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,": ""development"",
""user_identities"": {...},
""events"": [...]
}
let options = MParticleOptions(
key: ""REPLACE WITH APP KEY"",
secret: ""REPLACE WITH APP SECRET""
)
options.dataPlanId = ""mobile_data_plan""
options.dataPlanVersion = 2
options.environment = MPEnvironment.development;
MParticle.sharedInstance().start(options);
var options = MParticleOptions.builder(this)
.credentials(""REPLACE WITH APP KEY"", ""REPLACE WITH APP SECRET"")
.environment(MParticle.Environment.Development)
.dataplan(""mobile_data_plan"", 2)
.build()
MParticle.start(options)
window.mParticle = {
config: {
isDevelopmentMode: true,
dataPlan: {
planId: 'mobile_data_plan',
planVersion: 2,
}
}
};
Data that has not been tagged with an existing plan ID and environment is not validated. You must include these values in every upload.
Now that you have tagged incoming data, use Live Stream to debug violations as they occur.
Step 4: Monitor Your Plan
Once your plan is validating data, violations reports help monitor your data quality. ",20,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,"To view violations, click Unique Violations in the header row of your data plan’s home screen. This will display a violation report like the one below:
It can take up to 5 minutes for new violations to be reflected in reports.
Step 5: Update Your Plan
Your data needs change over time. Data plans can be easily updated to reflect these changes.
Smaller changes can be made directly to an existing plan version. Updates to active data plans are live immediately: simply update the plan in the UI and save your changes. For larger changes, we recommend creating a new plan version. Creating a new plan version allows you to track changes over time and to revert back to an older version if necessary.
If you’re using a Data Plan Builder, make the update in the builder and follow instructions to export a new data plan version into mParticle.
When updating or uploading a data plan by copying and pasting JSON (as when using the Data Plan Builder), you must update the version description separately in",21,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/," the mParticle UI.
If you've pinned your SDK or Events API payload to a plan version, update your code to point to the version. If you have omitted the plan version in your implementation, mParticle will automatically find the latest version that is active in development or production.
To view the version history of a data plan:
Log in to mParticle and navigate to Data Master > Plans in the left nav bar.
Select a data plan from the list.
Hover your cursor over the details icon (…), and click View Plan History.
Step 6: Block Unplanned Data from Being Forwarded to Downstream Systems
Once you are confident that your plan reflects the data you want to collect, you can block unplanned data from being forwarded to downstream systems. Learn more about blocking data in the next section.
Blocking Bad Data
Enabling blocking will impact your data stream and can lead to data loss. Work closely with your mParticle representative when implementing this feature for your production data stream.
Using ",22,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,"Data Plans, you can block unplanned data from being forwarded to downstream systems. You can think of this feature as an allowlist (sometimes called a whitelist) for the data you want to capture with mParticle: any event, event attribute, or user attribute that is not included in the allowlist can be blocked from further processing.
Limitations
You cannot replay blocked data through the UI. If you have set up a Quarantine Connection, we offer instructions and sample scripts for replaying blocked data in our backfill guide.
Only custom_attributes can be blocked from client-side kits. Other unplanned event attributes will not be blocked client-side. Learn more in the Blocking data sent to mParticle Kits section.
Quarantine Connections
To prevent blocked data from being lost, you can opt for blocked data to be forwarded to an Output with a Quarantine Connection. To illustrate a typical workflow, assume you choose to configure an Amazon S3 bucket as your Quarantine Output:
Anytime a data p",23,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,"oint is blocked, the Quarantine Connection will forward the original batch and metadata about what was blocked to the configured Amazon S3 bucket. You will then be able to:
Examine the blocked data in greater detail.
Backfill data that was mistakenly blocked by following our backfill guide.
Blocking Data Sent to mParticle Kits
What’s a Kit?
In most cases, data collected by the mParticle SDK is sent to mParticle and then forwarded on to an integration partner server-to-server. However, in cases where a server-to-server integration cannot support all required functionality for an integration, an embedded kit can be used instead.
A kit is a client-side wrapper of an integration’s SDK. Some kits (e.g. AppsFlyer, Apptentive, Branch, Braze) will forward data directly to the integration partner from your client application.
You can learn which integrations are kits for a given SDK here:
Web
iOS
Android
How Do I Block Data Before It Is Sent to a Kit?
By default, the current Block feature suppo",24,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,"rts blocking for server-side integrations. If you would like to enable blocking for mParticle kits, you need to follow additional steps outlined below for each of our most popular SDKs: Web, Android and iOS.
Step 1: Build a Data Plan and Reference It in Your Code
Before you can enable the blocking feature, you need to create a data plan and initialize the respective SDK with a data plan ID in your code. Read our “Getting Started” section for detailed guidance.
Step 2: Ensure That You are Using the Right SDK Version

Our SDKs are served by a CDN that caches SDK configuration, including your data plan, for some period of time (the “TTL”). As a result, updates to a data plan can take time before they are reflected in your client code. To avoid caching a plan version while you are iterating on it:
Explicitly mention the plan version in your code.
Create a new",25,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/," plan version when you make changes.
Update the plan version in your code to point to the latest version. The resulting changes in the URL will sidestep previously cached versions.
Step 3: Turn on Block Settings for Your Plan Version
You can now turn on Block settings for the type of data you would like to block by completing the following steps:
Open your data plan version in the UI and navigate to the Block tab.
Enable “Block unplanned events” or any other block setting. Events are a good place to start blocking.
Step 4: Verify That Data Is Being Blocked before It Is Forwarded to a Kit Integration
For Web, you can use the developer console to verify when a kit’s underlying SDK uploads an event to the partner’s API. For iOS and Android, you can typically use verbose console logs or a proxy such as Charles Proxy. Depending on your block settings, you should see unplanned data removed from payloads. For example, if you have not planned “Bad Event A”, “Bad Event A” will not be forwarded ",26,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,"to a specific partner integration.
""Bad Event A"" will still be uploaded to mParticle, so mParticle can report the blocked event in Live Stream and in your data planning report.
Step 5: Deploy Your Changes
Follow your usual software development process to deploy your code changes to production. Remember to also promote your data plan version to prod through the mParticle UI to start blocking production data that does not match your plan. Plan versions active on production are locked in the UI to prevent accidental updates. The recommended flow for updating a production plan is to clone the latest version and to deploy a new version after testing.
FAQ
How does the memory quota work?
To protect shared resources, every mParticle account includes a memory quota for active data plan versions. The byte size of a plan version’s JSON representation is a good estimate of its memory footprint. The typical data plan version size is approximately 50 KB.
You can verify your current usage, check the ",27,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,"size of a data plan, and if needed, take action to reduce your memory quota usage:
To find your quota limit and current usage, navigate to Data Master > Data Plans.
To download the JSON file for a data plan to check its size, navigate to Data Master > Data Plans, click a plan name to open it, and then click the Download as JSON icon above the Unique Violations area.
To stay within an account’s memory quota, deactivate plan versions that you aren’t using. Draft plan versions don’t count against your quota, only active plan versions do.
Contact your mParticle representative if you need more memory provisioned for your account.
How do I enable validation?
To enable validation, you need to point your code to a data plan id with at least one active version. For a version to be considered active, its status has to be set to dev or dev & prod.
You can either pin your code to a specific data plan version or omit the version, in which case mParticle will match the data you send with the latest ",28,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,"plan version that is active in a given environment (dev or prod). Learn more about how to implement a data plan with Getting Started.

The Other identifiers allow you to enter up to ten different custom strings against which to validate data.
How do I validate the shape of event schemas?
Here’s an example schema configuration for a screen event called “Sandbox Page View”:
This configuration states the following:
The custom_attributes object is required and any additional attributes that are not listed below should be flagged – the behavior for additional attributes is implied by the validation dropdown for the custom_attributes object.
An attribute called anchor is a string, and it’s required.
An attribute called name is a string, and it’s optional.
Let’s look at a couple examples to see this schema validation in action.
Example 1
window.mParticle.logPageView(
'Sandbox Page View',
{
'anchor': '/home',
'name': 'Home',
}
)
This event passes validation.
Example 2
window.mParticle.logPageView(
'Sandbox Page View',
{
'name': 'Home',
}
)
This event fails validation since the required anchor attribute is excl",30,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,"uded.
Example 3
window.mParticle.logPageView(
'Sandbox Page View',
{
'anchor': '/home',
}
)
This event passes validation: The name attribute is excluded but optional.
Example 4
window.mParticle.logPageView(
'Sandbox Page View',
{
'anchor': '/home',
'label': 'Home'
}
)
This event fails validation: The label attribute is unplanned and custom_attributes has been configured to disallow additional attributes. You can change this behavior by changing the validation of the custom_attributes object to Allow add'l attributes (see below).
What do valid events look like on the developer side?
If you’re looking for an example of how to implement events that conform to your data plan, download your data plan and check out our Snippets Tool. This tool will show you how to implement every data point in your plan for any of our SDKs.
How are attribute types validated?
Since various mParticle features (Audiences, Calculated Attributes, Forwarding Rules, some integrations) will automatically convert str",31,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,"ing representations of numbers and booleans to their respective types, data planning does not distinguish between raw numeric or boolean values (e.g. 42 or true) and their string representation (e.g. ""42"" or ""true"").
As long as the value can be converted to a type, it is considered valid.
How can I validate specific event, user and identity attributes?
You can validate specific attributes differently depending on detected type. Learn more about how type validation works here.
Numbers
Number can be validated in two ways:
An inclusive numeric range as implemented by the JSON Schema’s minimum and maximum keywords. Learn more here.
A fixed list of integers as implemented by the JSON Schema’s enum keyword. Learn more here.
Strings
String can be validated in three ways:
A fixed list of allowed strings as implemented by JSON Schema’s enum keyword. Learn more here. Within an enum value, commas are not allowed.
A regex pattern.

Where in mParticle’s data pipeline are plans enforced?
Ingestion, plan validation (and blocking), and event forwarding occur in the following sequence:
Step 1: Client Logs an mParticle Event Batch
Use any API client or SDK to send data to the Events API, and tag the data with your plan ID and, optionally, a plan version. For instructions, see Step 1 in Getting Started.
If you are using an mParticle kit to forward data to a destination, and you have enabled blocking of bad data, you can configure popular client SDKs to block bad data before it is forwarded to a kit. Learn more about blocking bad data before it is sent to kits here.
Step 2: Rules Are Applied
Your data then passes through the mParticle Rules engine. You can use your Rules to further enrich or fix your data.
Step 3: Plan Validation and Blocking
Data is then validated and, optionally, blocked. You can see dev data being validated in real-time with Live Stream.
Step 4: P",33,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,"rofile Storage
Data is then sent to the mParticle profile storage system. When you block bad data, it is dropped before being stored on a profile. Learn more about what happens when data is blocked here.
Step 5: Outbound Integrations
Your data then passes through the rest of the mParticle platform and is sent outbound, including:
Outbound Rules
the mParticle Audience system
all Event and Audience-based integrations
What do the different violations mean?
During plan enforcement, mParticle will generate violations when actual data does not match expectations. mParticle tracks the following types of violations:
Unplanned Event
The event type and name combination is not expected.
Unplanned Event Attribute
The attribute is not expected on a specific event.
Unplanned User Attribute or Identity
The user attribute or identity is not expected.
Invalid Attribute
This means the attribute is expected, but it has one or more data quality violations such as:
Invalid Data Type: The data type of an at",34,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt

Invalid Expected Value: The value associated with an attribute does not match expectations. Learn more about attribute validation here.
What do I need to know before enabling block settings?
Enabling blocking will impact your data stream and can lead to data loss. Work closely with your mParticle representative when implementing this feature for your production data stream.
Limitations
You can’t replay blocked data through the UI. If you have set up a Quarantine Connection, we offer instructions and sample scripts for replaying blocked data in our backfill guide.
You can’t block the following items:
Unplanned identifiers

What happens to blocked data?
Blocked data is dropped from your data stream before it is consumed by other mParticle features, such as:
User Profiles, as viewed in User Activity View and accessed through the",35,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/," Profile API
Filters
Catalog
Audiences
For debugging and reporting purposes, blocked data is shown in Live Stream and the Data Plan Report. Unless you create a Quarantine Connection, you won’t be able to recover blocked data.
Does blocking data impact how mParticle counts MTU or events?
Blocking data does not impact MTU or (ingested) event counts.
Quarantine Connections
To prevent blocked data from being lost, you can opt for blocked data to be forwarded to an Output with a Quarantine Connection. To illustrate a typical workflow, assume you choose to configure an Amazon S3 bucket as your Quarantine Output.
Anytime a data point is blocked, the Quarantine Connection will forward the original batch and metadata about what was blocked to the configured Amazon S3 bucket. You will then be able to:
Examine the blocked data in greater detail.
Backfill data that was mistakenly blocked.
Learn more about how to use quarantined data in the Blocked Data Backfill Guide.
Linting
We’ve developed tools",36,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/," for you to be able to lint your Swift, Kotlin/Java, and JavaScript/TypeScript code. For more information, see Linting Tools.
mParticle Snippets Tool
The mParticle Snippets tool helps you to generate example code blocks that log events using the mParticle SDKs in a way that conforms to a specified data plan.
For example, if a data plan includes a data point for a custom event with 10 different attributes, you can create the exact code that will log that event with all of its attributes by running the data plan through the Snippets tool.
This is helpful when integrating the mParticle SDK into your app if you are unsure which method to call to log a specific event or how to ensure that all of an event’s attributes are captured correctly.
To use the Snippets tool:
Copy the raw JSON of your data plan. For an example, you can test the Snippets tool using the data plan created for the mParticle sample web app, The Higgs Shop.
Navigate to the Snippets tool at mparticle.github.io/data-planning",37,guides_data-master_data-planning_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/data-planning/,"-snippets
Paste the data plan JSON in the left column.
Use the language dropdown menu to select the appropriate language for the SDK you are using. For the sample Higgs Shop web app data plan, select Web SDK.
The right column will automatically populate with example code blocks for each data point in the data plan. The Higgs Shop web sample app plan includes 16 different events, and the generated code block for each event includes a comment describing the action that will trigger the event based on the data point’s description plan.
For example:
// Data Plan Point 6
// User added product to cart
let product = mParticle.eCommerce.createProduct('productName', 'productId', 19.199, 1)

Data Forwarding and Connections
Data about an event, including individual attributes, may be forwarded from the input to an output in a variety of ways:
Server-side: Data is forwarded from the web or client app to mParticle servers, stored there, and from there is forwarded on to an output or destination such as Braze. For these types of forwarding, no client set",9,guides_platform-guide_connections_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,"up is needed, because the client communicates directly with mParticle.
Client-side: Data is forwarded from the web or client app directly to the output, unseen by mParticle servers. For this type of forwarding, you must set up your client, usually by adding a kit to the platform SDK of the client app.
Some integrations allow you to choose either server-side or client-side when you configure a connection.
Connection Workflow
No matter which data flow your integration uses, a connection is required. A connection is the combination of an input, an output, and the configuration information required to make the connection work. Most of the configuration information is specified in the mParticle UI, but some values may need to be fetched from the output, and you may need to add a kit to an SDK for some client-side integrations.
The Connections screen controls how event data from your inputs (iOS, Android, Web, Feeds, etc) is forwarded to your output platforms. You must set up a separate conn",10,guides_platform-guide_connections_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,"ection for each input-output-configuration combination. For each connection, you have several opportunities to cleanse and filter your data, to ensure that each output receives the data you want it to receive, in the correct format.
Each output has its own requirements, so the process for setting up each connection is a little different. However, all connections require these basic steps:
Create a connection.
If needed, add a kit to the SDK for your input platform.
Activate the connection.
Verify that data is being forwarded.
Create a Connection
Data flows once an input and output are connected and the connection is active. For an overview before you create your first connection, view the following video:
1. Select an input
Navigate to Connections > Connect in the mParticle UI.
From the list displayed, select the input you want to configure. If the list is empty, go to Setup > Inputs to create an input.
2. Apply ‘All Outputs’ transformations
Once you have an input selected, you can set",11,guides_platform-guide_connections_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/," up transformations that are applied to all outputs connected to that input. Click All Outputs to see options.
Warning: Because rules are processed before storage and processing, if you apply a subtractive rule to all outputs and apply it between stages 1 and 2, such as dropping events from a batch, you may remove data that you don't intend to remove and the data may not be recoverable because it's dropped before storage and processing.
There are two transformations that can be applied here:
Rules
User Splits
3. Select an Output
Once you have selected an input, you will see a list of available outputs that can receive data from your selected input. If this list is empty, go to Setup > Outputs to create some outputs.
The following video shows how to create an output:
The mParticle UI may indicate that you need or may need to add a reference to a kit in your platform dependency configuration. You can do this after you create the connection but before you change the Connection Status to a",12,guides_platform-guide_connections_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,"ctive. See Add a Kit for more information.
If you are planning to apply any data transformations to the connection, make sure the Connection Status switch in the output Connection Settings page is set to off.
4. Complete Connection Settings
Complete any settings that apply to the connection. These will be different for every output but can include:
Credentials or Account/Workspace identifiers
What user identifiers and attributes should be sent. You must choose a User Identification (identity type) or data may not flow.
Encoding to be used for identifying data
How custom attributes should be mapped
How to handle attributes specific to the Output
The minimum platform version of your input that the connection will forward data from.
If you set the Min Platform Version connection setting, then mParticle will only forward data from inputs with an application_version that is equal to or greater than the version you set. This allows you to create a separate connection for different versions o",13,guides_platform-guide_connections_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,"f your app.
The version number you set for the Min Platform Version connection setting must only contain numeric characters (0 through 9) and decimals (.) Using any non-numeric characters when setting your Min Platform Version will cause the connection to fail.
5. Apply ‘Specific Output’ transformations
The second set of transformations apply only to your selected Output. Click Specific Output to see options. Specific output transformations include:
Event Filter - note, this is not part of Connections Screen but should be configured before the next step if needed.
Specific Outputs Rules
Forwarding Rules
Custom Mappings
User Sampling
Add a Kit
When you configured your output in step 3, the mParticle UI may have indicated that you do need or may need a kit added to the SDK for your app or web pages:
If so, check the integration documentation for your output. If a kit is required, follow the instructions for adding the kit to your input platform dependency configuration.
Activate the Conn",14,guides_platform-guide_connections_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,"ection
After you have completed the required settings, set up any transformations, and added a kit (if needed), you are ready to activate the connection:
Navigate to Connections.
Select the input for your connection.
Click the output you are ready to activate.
Click the Connection Settings gear icon.
Click the Connection Status slider so it displays Active.
Click Save.
Very large data volumes may take up to 48 hours to process. To reduce processing time, reduce the number of sessions your account sends to fewer than 200,000 per day.
Verify Your Connection
Verify that data is flowing. Check in the mParticle UI and in your downstream app or system (output).
Step 1: Verify that data is flowing from the input to the output
Wait for the time indicated in the mparticle UI to ensure your connection has been activated. Additionally, some outputs such as Google Analytics have their own processing delays. Check the “Data Processing” section of [the integration documentation(/integrations) for yo",15,guides_platform-guide_connections_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,"ur output.
Open Data Master > Live Stream and select the following values:
The input from Inputs
The output from Outputs
In Message Direction, select Both In and Out to check whether events are being forwarded.
In Device, leave the default value All Dev Data unless you are verifying the flow to a device in production. In that case, choose the relevant device.
Check that you have chosen a User Identification (identity type).
Events should be listed as they occur:
If you don’t see events being forwarded, troubleshoot your connection.
Step 2: Verify that data is arriving in the downstream system
To verify that data is arriving n the downstream system:
In mParticle, look in Data Master > Live Stream and select an event.
Search for that event in your downstream system.
If you don’t see events being forwarded, troubleshoot your connection.
Troubleshooting Connections
Follow these steps to troubleshoot an event connection:
Make sure you have waited for the time period specified in the mPartic",16,guides_platform-guide_connections_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,"le UI before troubleshooting further.
Check Activity > System Alerts for any fatal errors or warnings and resolve them.
If your events are not appearing in the output although the mParticle Live Stream suggests that the connection is active, follow the steps in Verify your connection to ensure your connection is working. Although Live Stream has indicated that events are forwarded downstream, there might be issues downstream that prevent successful forwarding. The next steps will help you find this type of problem.
Does your connection depend on a kit? Does your connection use a kit to forward data downstream? Has the kit been included in your application? If yes, check your application for HTTP requests directed to the partner. Have they succeeded or are they reporting errors?
Does your connection use batch forwarding? Some outputs use batch forwarding. You might have to wait longer for events to arrive in these systems (approximately 10 minutes or after several event batches have bee",17,guides_platform-guide_connections_.txt

All Outputs Transformations
See Rules for more information on all-output rules.
Specific Output Transformations
mParticle lets you customize the data that you send to each output. There are many reasons to do this, including:
Filtering out personally identifiable information (PII);
Filtering out data containing company insights you don’t want to share with a particular service;
Filtering out events that you don’t need to track in a particular service;
Filtering out information from places or customer types you don’t want to track in a particular service;
Enriching the data you send to a service with extra user info from an external source;
Reformatting your data to match what a particular service accepts.
The Data Filter
Unlike other transformations, the data filter exists on its own page, separate from the Connections screen. A data filter allows you to decide which events/attributes you want to send to each output.",18,guides_platform-guide_connections_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/," By default, all event attributes are enabled when you first activate a connection. From the event filter you can:
Decide whether new events and attributes should be forwarded by default.
Turn forwarding on/off for each event, by event name.
Turn forwarding on/off for attributes of each event, by attribute name.
See The Data Filter for more information.
Forwarding Rules
Like the event filter, forwarding rules let you filter out events from being sent to an Output. But where the event filter is based on event and attribute names, forwarding rules look at values, which lets you build some more complex conditions. There are several types of forwarding rules.
Attribute: Attribute rules take an event attribute name and a value. You can choose to either not forward events that match the rule, or to only forward events that match the rule, excluding all others. Greater than / less than comparisons are not possible. Matching is case sensitive and exact.
If an attribute is criteria for the forw",19,guides_platform-guide_connections_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,"arding rule, but is omitted from the source payload, it is treated as if the attribute key exists and the value doesn’t match.
Attribution: Attribution rules filter events according to Publisher information. You can choose to exclude events attributed to a specific publisher, or forward only events attributed to that publisher.
Consent: Data privacy controls allow you to filter events based on whether a user has given consent to a particular data collection purpose.
ID Sync: ID Sync rules allow you to only forward data from logged-in users. A logged in user is one with at least one Login ID, as defined by your Identity Strategy.
User Sampling
User Sampling is applied to a single output and sends only a subset, or sample of your data to an output. The main reason to do this is to control costs on services that charge by volume of data. Data is sampled on a user level, not an event level - if you select a 50% sample, mParticle forwards all data received from half of your users, not half ",20,guides_platform-guide_connections_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,"of each user’s data.
Specific Output Rules
See Rules for more information about specific-output rules.
Custom Mappings
Some services allow your incoming events to be translated into events specific to the service. For example, if you have a custom event named “NextLevel”, typically this event would be forwarded as a custom event to a service. With custom mappings, you can specify that this event be forwarded to a service using their specific event name. For example:
Integration
Integration Description
Integration Event Name
Criteo
User Level Finished
UserLevel
Facebook
Achieved Level
fb_mobile_level_achieved
For partners that support custom mappings, the output’s events are listed on the left side of the Custom Mappings tab. For each event, you can then select an mParticle event and associated attributes to map to the partner’s event.
The following integrations support custom mappings:
AgilOne
Algolia
Amazon Mobile Analytics
AppLovin
AppsFlyer
Criteo
Facebook
Fiksu
Google Ads Enhanced ",21,guides_platform-guide_connections_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,"Conversions
Google Analytics for Firebase
Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
Iterable
NCR Aloha
Optimizely
SimpleReach
Snapchat
TikTok
If an event has a Custom Mapping for a particular connection, it will be displayed with an icon in the Event Filter
If you turn off forwarding of an event with a Custom Mapping, the mapping information will be deleted.
mParticle Forwarder Module
The final and most crucial transformation step is the mParticle Forwarder Module itself.
After all your other transformations have been completed, the forwarder module turns your data into messages to the output in its preferred format.
Each integration has its own forwarding module. Settings for the forwarder are derived from three places:
Some data is handled based on hard-coded settings. For example, any device information (such as device model or operating system type) the output service accepts is usually forwarded without the user needing to set anything up.
Some data is handled according to the connection settings.",22,guides_platform-guide_connections_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/," For example, in the Mixpanel settings, you can choose whether you want to forward session events, and decide what they should be called.
Any custom mappings you have created.
Based on these settings, mParticle transforms your data into a format accepted by the output. This can involve extensively reformatting the data. For example, Mixpanel’s API accepts events, with attributes given as a flat set of key-value pairs. To fit this structure, a single mParticle eCommerce event with four products will be transformed into four Mixpanel Events - one for each product - with common attributes, such as user and device info, repeated for each event.
The documentation for each integration will tell you what you need to know about how data is transformed to be accepted by the Output service.
Best Practice for Transformations
mParticle provides many opportunities to transform and enrich your data. It is often possible to perform the same transformation in more than one place. For example, if you w",23,guides_platform-guide_connections_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/,"anted to drop all Application State Transition events for a given output, you could use the event filter, or you could write a condition in an output rule. There are advantages to each choice. The event filter can be used by anyone with the appropriate access to your organization in the mParticle Dashboard, so it is easy to update and maintain. Writing a rule gives you much finer control over your data, but rules may be difficult for non-developers to understand or alter.
Make the necessary transformations to your data in as few steps as possible. The fewer times you alter your data, the easier your integration will be to troubleshoot and maintain.

Identity API
The identity API is used by all of mParticle’s SDKs to log users in and out of your app, to search for, and to modify a current user’s identities. It is also available as an HTTP API.
The identity API provides four endpoints for identifying users:
Identify - called when a session begins with whatever identifying information is available
Search - called to find current user identities or determine if a specific user exists
Login - called when a known user signs into the app.
Logout - called",9,guides_idsync_components_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/components/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/components/," when a known user signs out
These four endpoints are called in response to different user actions, but they all perform the same function - resolving a request containing all known identifying information for the current user into a single, unique mParticle User Profile. That profile might be:
An existing profile that matches all identifying information in the request
An existing profile that matched some identifying information in the request, updated to include new information.
A new user profile, created when no existing profiles matched the request.
Identity strategies
Identity strategies determine which user profile to add data to when the current user can be identified, and what to do when the current user cannot be identified.
There are 5 identity strategies that have been designed to handle different business and privacy requirements.
Profile conversion
The profile conversion strategy is designed to help build a comprehensive picture of a user’s entire journey through a tradit",10,guides_idsync_components_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/components/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/components/,"ional sales funnel.
The main distinguishing feature of this strategy is that when a new login ID is received, IDSync will not create a new profile. Instead, it will simply add the new login ID to the previous profile used to store data collected when the user was anonymous.
Default identity strategy
The default identity strategy is a simplified version of the profile conversion strategy. The main difference is that the unique ID and login ID for the default identity strategy are set to customer_id, and they cannot be changed.
The default identity strategy is used for any new mParticle accounts participating in the mParticle Accelerator Program.
Profile link
The profile link strategy is optimized to track the events that drive users to create an account or make purchases.
Profile isolation
The profile isolation strategy is built to prevent any anonymous data from being attributed to known users. This strategy is helpful when strict compliance with consumer protection and privacy regulat",11,guides_idsync_components_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/components/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/components/,"ion is required.
Best match
The best match strategy is not optimized to help uniquely identify users. It is best suited for businesses that do not have a login flow or that provide their primary services without requiring users to log in.
Identity priorities
Each identity strategy must define the order of precedence for matching user profiles. When an identity request is received, mParticle looks up matching profiles for each identifier in the order defined by the identity priority until a single profile can be returned. Keep in mind that some identity strategies impose minimum requirements that a request must fulfill in order to return a user even if they match (see Login Identities). For now, let’s just look at how the identity priority can affect which profile is returned by a request.
Example
User profiles
Profile 1
Profile 2
Email: h.jekyll.md@example.comIDFV: 1234Other: AAAA
Email: h.jekyll.md@example.comGAID: 2345Other: BBBB

1. Customer ID 2. Email 3. Other4. IDFV5. GAID
Email: h.jekyll.md@example.comOther:AAAA IDFV: 2345
Highest priority lookup (email) returns Profiles 1 and 2. Next highest priority (other) used as a tiebreaker. Profile 1 is returned. Other identifiers may or may not be updated based on the type of IDSync API request.
1. Customer ID 2. Email 3. IDFV4. GAID
Email: h.jekyll.md@example.comGAID: 2345
Highest priority lookup (email) returns both Profiles 1 and 2. Next highest priority (IDFV) is not in the request, Following highest priority (GAID) used as a tiebreaker. Profile 2 is returned.
When Choosing your identity priority, ask the following questions about each of the identities you collect:
Is it an immutable ID? An immutable ID, such as Customer ID, must be the top rank identifier above all other IDs since it is a definitive customer identifier that is often shared across multiple apps or business areas in your organization.
Are they unique IDs? Unique IDs should be near the top of yo",13,guides_idsync_components_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/components/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/components/,"ur hierarchy.
Do your customers use the ID to log in? Login IDs should also be near the top of your hierarchy.
Are they mutable? Some IDs may be changed by a user over time. Email is a good example.
Does it permanently identify a user? Some IDs are anonymous - cookies, device advertising IDs or other temporary IDs used for experimentation. Generally speaking, these should rank lower than IDs that permanently identify a user.
How likely are collisions for this ID? These should be ranked lowest in the hierarchy.
Feed specific user identifiers
There are some input feeds that always include a specific user identifier that you may or may not want to include in your identity priority list. To ensure that IDSync requests from one-off feeds like this can still be resolved even if you decided to omit their specific identifiers from your identity priority, you can configure an additional identifier for that specific feed without having to modify your overall identity priority.
If you ingest data",14,guides_idsync_components_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/components/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/components/," from a feed with an extra identifier configured, mParticle still attempts to resolve any IDSync requests using your normal identity priority list first. Then, if no matching profiles are found, mParticle tries any additional identifiers configured for the feed. If a matching profile is still not found, then mParticle handles the anonymous user according to your identity strategy.
To configure additional user identifiers for a feed, contact your mParticle account representative.
Example
For an example of how feed specific identifiers work, imagine the following two user profiles and stored identities:
Profile 1
IDFV: 1234
AID: 9876
Profile 2
Email: h.jekyll.md@example.com
GAID: 5678
Now imagine that we have the following identity priority list configured:
Customer ID
Email
IDFV
GAID
Let’s look at two scenarios where data is ingested from the same input feed with the same identity priority list described above.
Scenario 1: without a feed-specific user identifier
In this first scenario, ",15,guides_idsync_components_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/components/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/components/,"data is ingested from the feed and an IDSync request is made for a user with the only identifier being an AID of 9876.
Since AID isn’t used in the identity priority and AID isn’t configured as a feed-specific identifier, IDSync fails to resolve the identity and the user is treated anonymously according to the identity strategy even though Profile 1 would be a match for the user.
Scenario 2: with a feed-specific user identifier
In the second scenario, AID is configured as a feed-specific identifier. Now, if the same IDSync request is submitted for a user with an AID of 9876, IDSync resolves the request to Profile 1. However, this will only be successful if the IDSync request is made for data ingested from the same feed that has AID configured as a specific identifier.

This SDK is stateless and will only send the data that you populate, whereas our mobile SDKs will automatically collect app and device information, session events, install events, and maintain persistence. Read this wiki for a general overview and examples, and contact our customer support team to make sure you’re feeding the platform with the right data to power your",9,developers_server-sdks_java_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/java/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/java/," integrations. You can find the Java SDK hosted on Github.
Model Overview
Batch
All data sent via the SDK must be encapsulated in a Batch struct. Each Batch is associated with a single user. Batch objects must be associated with an environment (development or production) to properly silo your testing and production data.
//""DEVELOPMENT"" or ""PRODUCTION""
Batch batch = new Batch();
batch.environment(Batch.Environment.DEVELOPMENT);
User Identities
Most use-cases require that data be associated with a user identity, for example:
If you’re also sending data to mParticle via our mobile SDKs, set a customer ID both via the mobile SDKs and this SDK so that mParticle can correctly associate data with each user.
Several marketing automation and audience integrations are powered by email.
batch.userIdentities(
new UserIdentities()
.customerId(""1234"")
.email(""example@foo.com"")
);
Device Information
The DeviceInformation object describes the device that should be associated with this batch. Cruciall",10,developers_server-sdks_java_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/java/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/java/,"y, it exposes properties for device identities (Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID) which are required for nearly all mParticle Audience integrations.
batch.deviceInfo(
new DeviceInformation()
.iosAdvertisingId(""5864e6b0-0d46-4667-a463-21d9493b6c10"")
);
User Attributes
The mParticle audience platform can be powered by only sending a combination of user attributes, used to describe segments of users, and device identities/user identities used to then target those users.
Map<String, Object> userAttributes = new HashMap<>();
userAttributes.put(""foo"", ""bar"");
userAttributes.put(""foo-array"", new String[]{""bar1"", ""bar2""});
userAttributes.put(""foo-array-2"", Arrays.asList(""bar3"",""bar4""));
batch.userAttributes(userAttributes);
Events
Events are central to many of mParticle’s integrations; analytics integrations typically require events, and you can create mParticle Audiences based on the recency and frequency of different events. All events should be associated with a timestamp reflecting whe",11,developers_server-sdks_java_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/java/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/java/,"n they actually occurred, otherwise they will be assigned a timestamp when mParticle receives them.
Custom Event
Custom Events represent specific actions that a user has taken in your app. At minimum they require a name and a type, but can also be associate with a free-form dictionary of key/value pairs.
Map customAttributes = new HashMap<>();
customAttributes.put(""foo"", ""bar"");
CustomEvent event = new CustomEvent().data(
new CustomEventData()
.eventName(""My Custom Event Name"")
.customEventType(CustomEventData.CustomEventType.LOCATION)
);
event.getData().customAttributes(customAttributes);
Commerce Event
The Commerce event is central to mParticle’s Commerce measurement. Commerce events can contain many data points but it’s important to understand that there are 3 core variations:
Product-based: Used to measure measured datapoints associated with one or more products
Promotion-base: Used to measure datapoints associated with internal promotions or campaigns
Impression-based: Used to mea",12,developers_server-sdks_java_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/java/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/java/,"sure interactions with impressions of products and product-listings
Product product = new Product()
.totalProductAmount(new BigDecimal(""123.12""))
.id(""product-id"")
.name(""product-name"");
ProductAction action = new ProductAction()
.action(ProductAction.Action.PURCHASE)
.totalAmount(new BigDecimal(""123.12""))
.transactionId(""foo-transaction-id"")
.products(Arrays.asList(product));
CommerceEvent event = new CommerceEvent().data(
new CommerceEventData().productAction(action)
);
Full Example
The SDK provides an interface to the mParticle HTTP API by way of the EventsApi class.
At a minimum, the EventsApi must be initialized using the mParticle key and secret issued for your input.
To find your key and secret if you are using a platform input such as iOS or Roku:
Log into your mParticle account, and navigate to Setup > Inputs in the left nav bar.
From the Platforms tab, select the correct platform from the list to view its configuration.
Copy the key and secret, and use these when initializing",13,developers_server-sdks_java_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/java/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/java/," the Events API.
To find your key and secret if you are using a custom feed as your data source:
Log into your mParticle account, and navigate to Setup > Inputs in the left nav bar.
Click the Feeds tab.
Click on the feed in the list displayed, and select the configuration you are using.
Copy the key and secret from the model, and use these when initializing the Events API.
You must associate your data with the correct key and secret. If your app is multi-platform, for example, be sure to send your Android data to your Android key/secret, and your iOS data to your iOS key/secret.
By default, the Java SDK will upload to the US1 Data Center URL.
If the API key you’re sending to exists in an mParticle Data Center that’s not US1, you must find the right URL for your hosting location on the mParticle docs site.
Using this URL, you can override the base url.

Indicative
Behavioral analytics in the mParticle platform. mParticle also includes functionality for customer data platforms (CDP), as well as decision making powered by machine learning with Cortex.
input
The configuration that defines how a partner sends data to an output. Inputs may be one of several types:
Platform inputs capture data sent by mParticle partners from an operating-system-specific device or the web. For example, ‘iOS’, ‘Android’, or ‘web.’
Feeds capture data sent by mParticle partners using feed integrations. There are several types of feeds: act-as feed, custom feed, and unbound feed.
install
A data point tracked by many mParticle partners, representing the action of a user installing the app on their device. In mParticle, an install corresponds to an Application State Transition event, of type Application Launch, where the attribute is_first_run is true.
integration
The flow of data from one of mParticle’s partners to another. Ty",19,guides_glossary_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/glossary/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/glossary/,"pes of integration include: event, audience, data warehouse, feed, data subject request, and cookie sync. Also referred to as integration partner or integration service.
kit
A component you add to an mParticle SDK that communicates directly with an integration partner from the app client. Usually the kit includes some or all of the partner’s own client-side SDK. Kits are not the same as SDKs. Also referred to as embedded kits. Kits are typically not needed for server-side integrations.
mapping
Each of mParticle’s integration partners uses a slightly different data structure, with different names for key data points. Mapping is the process of transforming mParticle data into a format that can be used by a partner, and vice versa. For some integration, mapping is customizable. For example, if a partner only collects one user ID, you may need to decide which mParticle identity type to map to the partner’s user ID. See also custom mapping.
Metered Integration
An integration type in which m",20,guides_glossary_.txt

workspace
A workspace is the basic container for data in an mParticle account. An account has one workspace already created; more can be created at any time. These logical containers control different types of scope. For example, the Profile API is set to workspace scope, while the Platform API is set to account scope.
Analytics
event
An event is a tracked user action. Examples of events are a user loading a page, clicking a button, or opening an email. Every analysis in Analytics starts with at least one event to analyze behavioral patterns. You can think of events as the “w",26,guides_glossary_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/glossary/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/glossary/,"hat” that a user has done.
event property
Event properties describe the context of an event. For example, event properties for the event “Button Click” could include the device type used to perform the event, the time zone the event was performed in, or the web browser through which the event was performed.
user property
Analytics isn’t just about tracking events, it’s also about tracking user. User Properties are the properties associated with the user performing an event, such as demographic factors, an email address, or the marketing channel through which the user was originally acquired. While event properties can differ from event to event, user properties are associated with every event performed by a given user.
query builder
Every analysis in Analytics is built in the query builder. Here, you may combine events, event properties, and user properties to create and visualize an analysis.
query row
A query row is a section within a query, and contains events, event properties, and",27,guides_glossary_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/glossary/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/glossary/,"/or user properties that will determine the analysis. A query may be composed of one or more query rows.
value
When an event property or user property is broken apart into its components, these components are referred to as values. For example, when looking at the property “Platform”, “iPhone” and “Android” are potential values.
numeric value
A value that contains only numbers. Numeric values may be used in calculations. For example, values under the property “Purchase Type” containing specific price information are numeric values.
string value
A value that contains letters, numbers, or other characters. String values are not used in calculations. For example, a User ID consisting only of numbers is a string value.
widget
A widget is a module on a dashboard within Analytics. Widgets provide both access to and results from saved analyses. Any analysis built in Segmentation, and Cohort may be added to a dashboard as a widget.Was this page helpful?YesNoLast Updated: February 27, 2025© 202",28,guides_glossary_.txt

Observability for Warehouse Sync
mParticle’s Observability offers support for tracing data ingested into your account through a Warehouse Sync pipeline. Simply select the pipeline feed you want to trace from the list of Feeds when creating a new trace configuration.
Trace configurations for Warehouse Sync pipelines will generate a new unique trace for each event batch generated by your pipeline within the timeframe you specify in your configuration. Like other trace configurations, pipeline traces display spans for each processing stage your data passes through once it’s ingested into mParticle.
Warehouse Sync traces do not currently provide row-specific details from your source database or details for diagnosing errors encountered during data ingestion. The current version of Warehouse Sync tracing is intended to help diagnose and troubleshoot issues encountered post-ingestion.

Warehouse Sync setup tutorial
Prerequisites
Before beginning the warehouse sync setup, obtain the following information for your mParticle account. Depending on which warehouse you plan to use, you will need some or all of these values:
Your mParticle region ID, or pod: either US1, US2, AU1, or EU1
Your Pod AWS Account ID that correlates with your mParticle region ID:
US1: 338661164609
US2: 386705975570
AU1: 526464060896
EU1: 583371261087
Your mParticle Org ID
Your mParticle Account ID
How to find your mParticle Org, Account, Region, and Pod AWS Account IDs
To find your Org ID, Account ID, Pod ID, and Pod AWS Account ID:
Log into the mParticle app at app.mparticle.com
From your web browser’s toolbar, navigate to view the page source for the mParticle app.
For ex",12,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"ample, in Google Chrome: Navigate to View > Developer > View Page Source in the toolbar. In the resulting source for the page, find and save the values for accountId, orgId, podName, and podId, as shown in the screenshot below.
1 Prepare your data warehouse
Work with your warehouse administrator or IT team to ensure your warehouse is reachable and accessible by mParticle.
Whitelist the mParticle IP address range so your warehouse will be able to accept inbound API requests from mParticle.
Ask your database administrator to perform the following steps in your warehouse to create a new role that mParticle can use to access your database. Select the correct tab for your warehouse (Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, or Databricks) below.
Snowflake
1.1 Create a new user
First, you must create a user in your Snowflake account that mParticle can use to access your warehouse.
Log into your Snowflake account at app.snowflake.com
Click + Create in the left hand navigation, and select S",13,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"QL Worksheet.
You must create your new user for mParticle using SQL statements so you can set the user type as legacy service. This exempts your new user from Snowflake's
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirement. Creating a new user in Snowflake's UI does not provide this option.
Select the database you want to connect to mParticle, and run the following SQL statement from the console:
// Mark your new user as a legacy service user to exclude it from Snowflake's multifactor authentication policy
CREATE OR REPLACE USER {{user_name}} PASSWORD = ""{{unique_secure_password}}"" TYPE = LEGACY_SERVICE;
Where:
{{user_name}}: The ID of the user that mParticle will log in as while executing SQL commands on your Snowflake instance.
{{unique_secure_password}}: a unique, strong password for your new user.
Beginning September 30th, 2024, Snowflake is enforcing Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all human users (as opposed to service users) that authenticate with a username and password in new ",14,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"Snowflake accounts, created after Snowflake's BCR 2024_08 bundle release. Service user accounts, which are often accounts designed for system-to-system or application-to-application communication, are exempted from Snowflake's MFA policy.
To prevent issues with your Snowflake configuration, make sure to set your new Snowflake user type as legacy service to exclude it from Snowflake's MFA policy by adding TYPE = LEGACY_SERVICE to the CREATE USER statement in your SQL statement. Alternatively, you can run the ALTER USER {{user_name}} SET TYPE = LEGACY_SERVICE; SQL statement to modify existing users.
1.2 Create a new role
mParticle recommends creating a dedicated role for your mParticle warehouse sync user created in step 1.1 above.
From the Users & Roles page of your Snowflake account’s Admin settings, select the Roles tab.
Click the + Role button.
Enter a name for your new role, and select the set of permissions to assign to the role using the under Grant to role dropdown.
Enter an opti",15,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt

Select your new role from the list of roles, and click the Grant to User button.
Under User to receive grant, select the new user you created in step 1.1, and click Grant.
Before continuing, make sure to save the following information, as you will need to refer to this when connecting Data Warehouse to your Snowflake account:
Role name: The role mParticle will use while executing SQL commands on your Snowflake instance. mParticle recommends creating a unique role for warehouse sync.
Warehouse name: The ID of the Snowflake virtual warehouse compute cluster where SQL commands will be executed.
Database name: The ID of the database in your Snowflake instance from which you want to sync data.
Schema name: The ID of the schema in your Snowflake instance containing the tables you want to sync data from.
Table name: The ID of the table containing data you want to sync. Grant SELECT privileges on any tables/views mParticle needs to access.",16,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt

Enter the region ide",29,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"ntifier corresponding to where your Snowflake data is localized following the format <cloud_region_id> or <cloud_region_id>.<cloud>, where <cloud> is an additional cloud provider ID, depending on the region your data is localized. To determine if you need to include the additional cloud provider ID:
First, refer to Snowflake’s list of region IDs to find the cloud region ID for your account. At the least, you will enter this value for your region ID.
Next, refer to Snowflake’s documentation on account locator formats by cloud platform and region to see if you need to include an additional cloud identifier by looking for your region in the left-most column and looking to see if a cloud ID is appended in the second column (e.g. aws, gcp, azure, etc.)
For example, if your data is localized in the US West (Oregon) region, you only need to enter us-west-2 as your cloud region ID. However, if your data is localized in US East (Ohio), you must enter us-east-2.aws, making sure to append .aws to",30,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/," your cloud region ID (us-east-2).
Do not include your account identifier (Snowflake uses the example account identifier xy12345 in their documentation linked above) when entering your region ID. You should only enter your cloud region ID and cloud provider ID (if necessary).
3.7 Add your Snowflake credentials
Finally, you must provide the username, password, and role specific to the database in Snowflake you are connecting to. These credentials are independent from the username and password you use to access the main Snowflake portal. If you don’t have these credentials, contact the Snowflake database administrator on your team.
Databricks
Connect to Databricks
3.1 Enter a configuration name
The configuration name is specific to mParticle and will appear in your list of warehouse inputs. You can use any configuration name, but it must be unique since this name is used when configuring the rest of your sync settings.
3.2 Enter your Databricks provider
The value you enter for your Datab",31,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"ricks provider must match the value of the Databricks organization that contains the schema you want to ingest data from. This is the same value that you saved when following Step 4 of the Data Warehouse setup, Find and save your Databricks provider name, prior to creating your warehouse connection.
3.3 Enter your Databricks schema
Enter the name of the schema in your Databricks account that you want to ingest data from. Databricks uses the terms database and schema interchangeably, so in this situation the schema is the specific collection of tables and views that mParticle will access through this Warehouse Sync connection.
4 Create data model
Your data model describes which columns from your warehouse to ingest into mParticle, and which mParticle fields each column should map to. While mParticle data models are written in SQL, all warehouse providers process SQL slightly differently so it is important to use the correct SQL syntax for the warehouse provider you select.
For a detaile",32,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"d reference of all SQL commands Warehouse Sync supports alongside real-world example SQL queries, see Warehouse Sync SQL reference.
Steps to create a data model
Write a SQL query following the guidelines outlined below and the Warehouse Sync SQL reference. Make sure to use SQL commands supported by your warehouse provider.
Enter the SQL query in the SQL query text box, and click Run Query.
Click Next.
mParticle submits the SQL query you provide to your warehouse to retrieve specific columns of data. Depending on the SQL operators and functions you use, the columns selected from your database are transformed, or mapped, to user profile attributes in your mParticle account.
If you use an attribute name in your SQL query that doesn’t exist in your mParticle account, mParticle creates an attribute with the same name and maps this data to the new attribute.
mParticle automatically maps matching column names in your warehouse to reserved mParticle user attributes and device ids. For example,",33,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/," if your database contains a column named customer_id, it is automatically mapped to the customer_id user identifier in mParticle. For a complete list of reserved attribute names, see Reserved mParticle user or device identity column names.
Example database and SQL query
Below is an example of a simple table and SQL query to create a data model:
Table name: mp.demo.userdata
Column names:
first_name
last_name
email
John
Doe
john@example.com
Example SQL query:
SELECT
first_name,
last_name,
email
FROM mp.demo.userdata
This SQL query selects the first_name, last_name, and email columns from the table called mp.demo.userdata. In the next step, we will set up the mappings for this user data.
5 Create data mapping
After creating a data model that specifies which columns in your warehouse you want to ingest, you must map each column to its respective field within mParticle with a data mapping.
If a field name within your destination contains a period (.) character, then the field name must be ",34,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"escaped using curly braces and single quotes. For example: {{'field.name'}}. This is due to how Warehouse Sync parses through nested objects and fields when creating your mappings. If a period is found that doesn't indicate a nested object or field, you will receive an error.
This is commonly encountered when mapping to an mParticle custom flag, such as TikTok.URL. Because URL isn't a field nested within an object called TikTok, Warehouse sync will return an error unless you enclose the entire field within curly braces: {{'TikTok.URL'}}.
To create a data mapping, first use the dropdown menu titled Type of data to sync to select either User Attributes & Identities Only or Events, depending on whether you want to ingest user data or event data.
To continue with our example user data table and SQL query from above, we’ll select User Attributes & Identities Only:
User Attributes & Identities Only
When mapping attributes and identities from your warehouse to fields in mParticle, you must al",35,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"ways create a user_identities or user_attributes object first. You can then create the individual mappings for your identities and attributes within these entities, as shown in the next two sections.
Warehouse Sync supports the same user identifiers as other input methods and adheres to the identity strategy you've configured.
Map user identities
To map your user identities:
Click Add Mapping.
Under Mapping Type, select Object.
Under Field in mParticle, select user_identites.
Click Save.
Within your new user_identities object, click the + button.
Under Mapping Type, select Column.
Under Column in warehouse enter the name of the column containing the identities you want to ingest. In this example, we’ll use a column called email.
Under Field in mParticle use the dropdown menu to select the correct user identity in mParticle you want to map your identities to. In this example, we’ll select Email Address.
Click Save.
Map user attributes
To map your user attributes:
Click Add Mapping.
Unde",36,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"r Mapping Type, select Object.
Under Field in mParticle, select user_attributes.
Click Save.
Within your new user_attributes object, click the + button.
Under Mapping Type, select Column.
Under Column in warehouse, enter the name of the column you want to map to mParticle. You can enter a specific column name, or $unmapped to select all currently unmapped columns.
Entering $unmapped selects all columns that are not already mapped to mParticle. In our example, because we’ve already mapped the email column to the Email Address field in mParticle, it will be excluded.
Under Field in mParticle enter the name of the field in mParticle that you want to map your column to.
If you entered $unmapped for your warehouse column selection, you can enter an asterisk (*) for Field in mParticle to use each unmapped column name in your warehouse as the respective field name in mParticle. This allows you to map all of your attributes at once so you don’t have to create a separate mapping for each indivi",37,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"dual attribute.
Click Save.
In addition to the user identities and attributes mappings, it's recommended that you also create a separate mapping for timestamp_unixtime, if your data model ingests that field.
Events
If you are ingesting event data instead of user data (as shown above), select Events under Type of data to sync once you reach the Review Mapping step.
Click Add Mapping.
Under Mapping Type, select Object.
Under Field in mParticle, select events.
Click Save.
Within the new events object, click the + button to add a new mapping.
Select the type of mapping you want to use from the Mapping Type dropdown:
Column - maps a column from your database to a field in mParticle
Static - maps a static value that you define to a field in mParticle
Ignore - prevents a field that you specify from being ingested into mParticle
The next steps will vary depending on the data you are ingesting and the mapping type you select. Following are several examples of how to use each mapping type.
Colum",38,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"n mapping
Under Column in warehouse, select the name of the column in your database you are mapping fields from.
Under Field in mParticle, select the field in mParticle you are mapping fields to.
Click Save.
Static mapping
Under Input Value select either String, Number, or Boolean for the data type of the static value you are mapping.
In the entry box, enter the static value you are mapping.
Under Field in mParticle, select the field you want to map your static value to.
Click Save.
Ignore mapping
Under Column in warehouse, select the name of the column that you want your pipeline to ignore when ingesting data.
Click Save.
To add additional mappings, click Add Mapping. You must create a mapping for every column you selected in your data model.
For event data pipelines, you should always create mappings for any of the following event attributes you plan to ingest within an events object:
event_type
timestamp_unixtime_ms
If you are ingesting custom events, you should also create mappings",39,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/," for:

custom_event_type
When you have finished creating your mappings, click Next.
6 Set sync settings
The sync frequency settings determine when the initial sync with your database will occur, and how frequently any subsequent syncs will be executed.
6.1 Select environment
Select either Prod or Dev depending on whether you want your warehouse data sent to the mParticle development or production environments. This setting determines how mParticle processes ingested data.
6.2 Select input protection level
Input protection levels determine how data ingested from your warehouse can contribute to new or existing user profiles in mParticle:
Create & Update: the default setting for all inputs in mParticle. This setting allows ingested user data to initiate the creation of a new profile or to be added to an existing profile.
Update Only: allows ingested data to be added to existing profiles, but not initiate the creation of new profiles.
Read Only: prevents ingested data from updat",40,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"ing or creating user profiles.
To learn more about these settings and how they can be used in different scenarios, see Input protections.
6.3 Select sync mode and schedule
There are two sync modes: incremental and full.
Incremental: Use this sync mode to only ingest data that has changed or been added between sync runs as indicated by your warehouse column you use as an iterator. The first run for incremental sync modes is always be a full sync.
Full: Use this sync mode to sync all data from your warehouse each time you execute a sync run. Use caution when selecting this sync mode, as it can incur to very high costs due to the volume of data ingested.
The remaining setting options change depending on the mode you select from the Sync mode dropdown menu. Navigate between the two configuration options using the tabs below:
Incremental Sync
Following are the sync settings for incremental syncs:
The main difference between full and incremental sync configurations is the use of an iterator ",41,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"field for incremental syncs. Both full and incremental syncs support all three sync modes (Interval, Once, and On Demand).
Iterator
Select the column name from your warehouse using the Iterator dropdown menu. The options are generated from the SQL query you ran when creating your data model.
mParticle uses the iterator to determine which data to include and exclude during each incremental sync.
Iterator data type
Select the iterator data type using the Iterator data type dropdown. This value must match the datatype of the iterator as it exists in your warehouse.
Sync schedule type
Select one of the following schedule types:
Interval: for recurring syncs that are run automatically based on a set frequency.
Once: for a single sync between a warehouse and mParticle that will not be repeated.
On Demand: for a sync that can run multiple times, but must be triggered manually.
Frequency of sync
The sync frequency setting is only applicable to interval syncs.
Sync frequencies can be either Hou",42,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"rly, Daily, Weekly, or Monthly.
The date and time you select for your initial sync is used to calculate the date and time for the next sync. For example, if you select Hourly for your frequency and 11/15/2023 07:00 PM UTC for your initial sync, then the next sync will occur at 11/15/2023 08:00 PM UTC.
Date & time of sync
Use the date and time picker to select the calendar date and time (in UTC) for your initial sync. Subsequent interval syncs will be scheduled based on this initial date and time.
Full Sync
Following are the sync settings for full syncs:
The main difference between full and incremental sync configurations is the use of an iterator field for incremental syncs. Both full and incremental syncs support all three sync modes (Interval, Once, and On Demand).
Sync schedule type
Select one of the following schedule types:
Interval: for recurring syncs that is run automatically based on a set frequency.
Once: for a single sync between a warehouse and mParticle that will not be re",43,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"peated.
On Demand: for a sync that can run multiple times, but must be triggered manually.
Frequency of sync
Sync frequencies can be either Hourly, Daily, Weekly, or Monthly.
The date and time you select for your initial sync is used to calculate the date and time for the next sync. For example, if you select Hourly for your frequency and 11/15/2023 07:00 PM UTC for your initial sync, then the next sync will occur at 11/15/2023 08:00 PM UTC.
Date & time of initial sync
Use the date and time picker to select the calendar date and time (in UTC) for your initial sync. Subsequent interval syncs will be scheduled based on this initial date and time.
6.4 Sync historical data
The value you select for Sync Start Date determines how much old, historical data mParticle ingests from your warehouse in your initial sync. When determining how much historical data to ingest, mParticle uses to the column in your database you selected as the Timestamp field in the Create Data Model step.
After your ini",44,guides_data-warehouse-sync_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-warehouse-sync/,"tial sync begins, mParticle begins ingesting any historical data. If mParticle hasn’t finished ingesting historical data before the time a subsequent sync is due to start, the subsequent sync is still executed, and the historical data continues syncing in the background.
Historical data syncing doesn’t contribute to any rate limiting on subsequent syncs.
The ""Sync Historical Data"" option for Warehouse Sync does not have the same limitations as the /bulkevents/historical API endpoint. All data (including historical data) ingested using Warehouse Sync is treated similarly to data ingested using the Events API /events endpoint.
After entering your sync settings, click Next.

Introduction
The purpose of this guide is to walk you through the basic steps of setting up mParticle in your app, unlocking core functionality, and troubleshooting common issues. Along the way, you’ll cover some important concepts you need to understand to be successful with mParticle.
This is not a complete guide to all of mParticle’s features and capabilities. If you already know your way around mParticle and you’re looking for in-depth docs, head to our Developers or Guides sections.
Most of this guide ",9,guides_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/,"is aimed at users of the mParticle Dashboard, but to follow along with the tutorials, you will need to set up the mParticle SDK in your iOS, Android or web app, so you may need support from a developer to complete some steps.
Examples
The tutorials in this guide follow the process of setting up mParticle in the mPTravel app: a mobile and web app that sells luxury travel packages to its users.
Later on in this guide, you’ll learn about sending data from mParticle to some of our many integration partners. As examples, the tutorials use services which are simple to set up and verify, and which offer a free account tier, so that you will be able follow the examples exactly if you wish. However, mParticle is agnostic about which integrations you choose and you can follow the same basic steps from this guide to implement any of our integrations.
Inputs and Outputs
One of the key functions of mParticle is to receive your data from wherever it originates, and send it wherever it needs to go. T",10,guides_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/,"he sources of your data are inputs and the service or app where it is forwarded are outputs. A connection is a combination of an input and output.
Inputs include:
Apps or services built on any platform we support, such as iOS, Android, or Web. You can view the full list in SETUP > Inputs in the PLATFORMS tab.
Data feeds of any other data you want to send into mParticle. This could be data you have collected yourself or from a feed partner. Once configured, feed inputs are listed in SETUP > Inputs on the FEEDS tab.
Outputs may be configured for events, audiences, cookie syncs, or data subject requests depending on what the output supports. You can see the list of configured outputs in SETUP > Outputs or SETUP > Data Warehouses. Outputs include:
Analytics partners such as Indicative
Advertising partners such as Facebook
In-app messaging partners such as Braze
Data Warehouse partners, such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake
To get started with mParticle, you need some data,",11,guides_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/," which means you need to create at least one input.
Create Access Credentials
The first thing you need to do is to to create a set of access credentials that will allow a client-side SDK or a server-side application to forward data to this workspace.
Login to your mParticle account. If you’re just getting started, your first workspace is created for you. The first screen you see is an overview of activity in the workspace. Since you haven’t yet sent any data, there’s nothing to report, so far.
Navigate to Setup > Inputs in the left column. Here you can see each platform type accepted by mParticle. Different platforms are associated with different sets of metadata, such as device identifiers, and most outputs only accept data from a limited set of platforms, so it is important to select the right platform. To capture data from your native Android app, choose Android. Just click the + next to your chosen platform.
Click Issue Keys.
Copy and save the generated Key and Secret.
About Access",12,guides_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/," Credentials
mParticle labels the credentials you create for an integration the key and secret, but they are not exactly like an API key and secret, since you embed these credentials in the app. However, this is not the security risk that exposing API credentials would be:
The client-side key and secret can’t read data from the system.
You can block bad data to stop any traffic that doesn’t match the data you expect as defined in your schema.
Most anonymous client-server architectures, including Adobe, Braze, Firebase, Google Analytics, and Segment don’t have per-session or per-instance credentials, nor does mParticle.
Install and Initialize an mParticle SDK
You need a developer to help you install and initialize an SDK. See the Getting Started guides for the iOS, Android or Javascript SDKs to get set up before continuing.
Verify: Look for Incoming Data in the Live Stream
Navigate to Activity > Live Stream in the left column. The Live Stream lets you inspect all incoming data from your",13,guides_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/," development environments. It’s an easy way to check that you have correctly initialized mParticle in your app. When you first open up the Live Stream, it will be empty, as we haven’t yet started sending data.
Start up a development build of your app (get a developer to help you if necessary). The mParticle SDKs automatically collect and forward data about installs and user sessions, so just by opening a development build of your app, you should start to see data in the Live Stream.
Advanced Platform Configuration Settings
For the iOS, Android, tvOS, and Web platforms, some advanced configuration settings are available. To change these settings, navigate to Setup > Inputs in the left column and select either iOS, Android, tvOS, or Web from the list of platforms.
Expand the Advanced Settings by clicking the + icon.
Restrict Device ID by Limit Ad Tracking
iOS, Android, and tvOS (Apple TV) devices allow users to limit the collection of advertising IDs. Advertising IDs are unique identifie",14,guides_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/,"rs you may use to associate event and user data with a specific device. For both iOS and Android devices, if a user has not provided explicit consent to share their device’s advertising ID, then the value of that ID is set to an all-zero value.
By checking Restrict Device ID by Limit Ad Tracking, mParticle will not collect advertising IDs from users who have enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device.
Remember, mParticle will collect advertising IDs for both iOS and Android devices, regardless of whether or not a user has enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device. However, the IDs collected from users who have opted out will be all-zero values.
Following are descriptions of Apple and Google’s policies for device advertising IDs:
iOS Advertising IDs
After the release of iOS 14.5, Apple introduced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, which requires app developers to request users’ explicit consent to share their advertising IDs. If a user of your app has ",15,guides_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/,"not provided this consent, Apple’s advertising ID (IDFA) will be set to all an all-zero value: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. Read more about Apple advertising identifiers in their documentation.
For more information about the ATT framework, visit the iOS 14 Guide.
Android Advertising IDs
Google allows Android users to opt out from sharing their devices’ advertising IDs. Similar to Apple’s policy, Google will set a user’s advertising ID (GAID or AAID) to an all-zero value if that user has opted out from sharing their ID. Read more about Google’s advertising identifiers in their documentation.
Collect Integration-Specific Identifiers
The Web SDK can collect integration-specific identifiers to enrich the user data forwarded to your connected outputs.
When Collect Integration-Specific Identifiers is checked, these integration-specific identifiers are collected and used to enrich your user data to help optimize the match rate of your audiences in downstream tools. Currently, these i",16,guides_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/,"dentifiers include Facebook’s fbc and fbp fields.

Troubleshoot
If you don’t see data appearing in the Live Stream within the first few minutes after opening a development build:
Check that you have copied your Key and Secret correctly
Check that you have properly included the mParticle SDK in your project and it is correctly initialized. The necessary steps will differ depending on the platform. Check our iOS, Android and Web docs for more.

The Braze Feed allows mParticle to receive Braze interaction data for the iOS, Android and Web platforms. It also supports an ‘unbound’ feed for events, such as emails, that are not connected to an app platform.
Enable the Braze Feed
Locate Braze in the mParticle Directory and add the Feed integration.
The Braze Feed Integration supports four separate feeds: iOS, Android, Web and Unbound. You will need to create an input for each feed. You can create additional inputs from Setup > Inputs, on the Feed Configurations tab.
For each feed, select an ‘Act as Application’ platform. For iOS, Android and Web, just select the appropriate option from the list. For your Unbound feed, leave this setting",14,integrations_braze_feed.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/feed,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/feed," at ‘Select Application’.
As you create each input, mParticle will provide you with a Key and Secret. Copy these credentials, making sure to note which feed each pair of credentials is for. Provide the credentials to your Braze account manager and ask them to enable the mParticle feed.
Common Event Data
All events from the Braze Feed will include any available user/device identifiers. Platform feeds will include basic device information.
User Identifiers
Customer ID
Email
Apple Vendor ID (IDFV)
Device Info
Platform
Device Model
Events
The Braze Feed sends events for tracking campaign performance. Included as custom attributes for each event are Braze’s IDs for the relevant Campaign, News Feed Card, Button, Canvas, etc. You can find the ID’s in the relevant sections of the Braze Dashboard under API Identifier. See Braze’s Identifier Types for more details.
You can also see a full list of your API Identifiers on Braze’s Developer Console.

Overview
The Activity Overview tracks basic stats for your workspace:
Activity
Description
Total Active
Count of all users that were active in your apps or websites.
App Installs
Count of application state transition “install” events. The Web SDK does not track “install” events, so this metric only applies to the mobile platform SDKs.
Sessions
Count",9,guides_platform-guide_activity_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/," of sessions in your apps or websites.
Average Session
Average session length.
Events Received
Count of events received. Use this value for diagnostic purposes and to help understand what data was being ingested in real time. The event counts are approximate and don’t include some events, such as those with old timestamps. It does include some events like consent grants and denials that aren’t included in the monthly Credit Usage Report, which details usage-based billing for value-based pricing customers.
Events Forwarded
Count of events forwarded to outputs.
Alerts
Displays the number of alerts which occurred when forwarding data to an output service.
Only the Fatal alert type is displayed.
Revenue
Displays total revenue.

The following user information will be displayed if available:
User Details
mParticle ID
Customer ID
Email Address
First and last seen dates (across all workspaces)
Bad User tag: On rare occasions, the User Details section will display a Bad User tag. This indicates that the mParticle backend noticed a suspiciously high event or device volume. If you see this tag and wish to learn more, contact support.
Workspace Usage
First and last seen dates (for the individual workspace)
Data Inputs and Partner Feeds the user has appeared in.
Device ID - only one Device ID will be shown, for the most recently seen device. The Advertising ID (",13,guides_platform-guide_activity_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/,"IDFA or GAID) will be shown for preference, with the Vendor ID (IDFV or Android ID) as a fallback.
Devices
List of all devices, including the date the device was last seen, device platform (iOS, Android, etc) and whether Limit Ad Tracking is enabled for the device.
User Attributes
List of all available user attributes. Display priority is given to reserved user attributes:
Age

Country
All other user attributes will be displayed in alphabetical order.
User attribute values may be updated by different inbound data streams. For example, a profile may be created, attributes may be added, updated, or deleted. Each change triggers a timestamp change for the altered attribute. When resolving differences in attribute values for the same profile, the value with the latest timestamp is used.
Attribution
A list of campaigns, showing Partner and Campaign name.
Audience Membership
A list of all Audiences the user is a member of.
",14,guides_platform-guide_activity_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/,"Events
The Events tab will show a timeline of historical event data from the user, up until the previous day. Events can be filtered by Date, Input, Event Type and Device. In addition to filtering, you can also choose to highlight selected event names in the timeline.
The Last Updated tag in the UAV Events view indicates the last time the data was refreshed on the page, not when the previous day's data has been loaded.
The timezone for this tag is UTC.
Events are grouped in batches, with the input source in bold. Click a batch heading to view common attributes for the batch, or an event name to view attributes for the event. eCommerce events show details for the transaction and also for each product, including quantity and total price per product.
Event data received with an event timestamp that is 72 hours older than the time it is received will not be captured in this report. For example: Today is February 24, 2022 at 11:00 UTC, I send an event to the API with event timestamp Februar",15,guides_platform-guide_activity_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/,"y 21, 2022 at 10:00 UTC. The report for February 21, 2022 view will not count the event.
Click the Link button in the details view to copy a sharable direct link to the event to your clipboard.
As with the Live Stream You can expand any event or batch to view the raw JSON data.
Edit a user profile
The User Activity View allows you to manually edit certain properties of individual user profiles. This can be useful if you need to correct profile data and you want the updated profile data to be immediately forwarded to your downstream connections.
Whenever you modify user profile data, you must select one of your configured inputs. This allows mParticle to route your changes through that input, updating the user profile, before finally forwarding the changes to any active, connected outputs.
If you do not want your changes to be forwarded to any downstream outputs, either create or select an input that does not have any connected outputs.
Each time you click Update to commit your changes ",16,guides_platform-guide_activity_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/,"to the user profile, a new eventless batch is ingested into mParticle. These batches count towards your event counts for event-based pricing, and will potentially impact your MTU counts under MTU-based pricing.
Changes are committed to profiles in mParticle in real time, but propagation to your connected outputs can take up to 48 hours, depending on the integrations you use. For details, refer to the documentation for your integrations or contact your mParticle account representative.
Edit a profile’s user attributes
To edit a profile’s user attributes:
Navigate to Activity > User Activity using the left-hand nav bar.

Event Forwarding
The Event Forwarding report provides information on your app’s incoming event data and the data that is forwarded to enabled output event services. This is where you can verify how much data mParticle captured per event, and how much data was forwarded.
If multiple configurations are enabled for an integration, the data sent to each configuration will be shown separately. We recommend checking this report if you notice any discrepancies in your vendor dashboards.
Event data received with an event timestamp that is 72 hours older than the time it is received will not be captured in this report. For example: Today is February 24, 2022 at 11:00 UTC, I send an event to the API with event timestamp February 21, 2022 at 10:00 UTC. The report for February 21, 2022 view will not count the event. Please work with mParticle Support to pull a report of total event counts if sen",30,guides_platform-guide_activity_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/,"ding backdated data.
The report displays a daily summary of events, plus counts for each message type and event name, along with the inbound and outbound counts for each enabled service.
By default a summary of data for a full day is shown, but you can also select a specific hour to display hourly data.
You may notice differences between an inbound data count and an outbound data count. There are several reasons these differences may occur. Here are some good questions to start with:
Did you enable/disable the service on the date in question?
Are you using data filters?
Is the message type not supported by the integration?
Have you chosen configuration or connection settings that exclude certain message types?
Are you sending commerce events that are expanded before being forwarded?
Commerce Event Types and Event Forwarding
Four events, called commerce events, capture information about financial transactions: product commerce events, purchase or refund commerce events, promotion commer",31,guides_platform-guide_activity_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/activity/,"ce events, and impression commerce events.
Commerce events behave differently from other events:
If the event is forwarded using an mParticle SDK with an embedded kit that doesn’t implement logCommerceEvent, then the event is expanded to ensure that no data is lost.
If the event is forwarded server-to-server or using an mParticle SDK with an embedded kit that does support logCommerceEvent, then no expansion is needed, and no data is lost.
In addition, the expansion behavior is different depending on the commerce event type:
Product commerce events and impression commerce events expand to one event per product.
Purchase or refund commerce events add an additional event with the total value.
Promotion commerce events expand to one event per promotion action type such as “click” or “view.”

User continuity
A common scenario for a media or ecommerce app goes something like this:
User downloads an app but has not yet registered an account.
User browses around in the app. Visits screens A, B and C. Data collection begins, but since the user has not yet registered, this activity is stored against an anonymous user profile identified only by an anonymous ID (such as a device ID).
User decides t",9,guides_idsync_use-cases_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/use-cases/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/use-cases/,"o register for an account, creating a new logged-in user profile, and continues to use the app while signed in. Visits screens D and E, and buys product F.
How should the data from this interaction be organized? There are two basic approaches:
Link the new logged-in user profile with the original anonymous one. This approach yields a continuous view of the user journey.
At the moment of user registration, create a new user profile and keep the post-signup activity completely separate from the pre-signup activity.
There are compelling business and legal arguments for and against each approach. By choosing the first approach, you have a chance to preserve a complete history of a user’s experience with your app. This might be invaluable for improving your funnel. However, you also introduce the possibility of mingling data from several users into a single profile. For example, on a shared device, multiple users might access the app in a pre-signup state.
The second approach sacrifices the",10,guides_idsync_use-cases_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/use-cases/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/use-cases/," possibility of collecting a user’s entire history under a single continuous view. However, you can be sure that the data from your logged-in users is never mixed up with data from a different user. Quarantining anonymous data from known user data may also be required by law.
IDSync is designed to let you make smart decisions about user continuity that fit the needs of your app and to give you transparency into how user profiles are created and updated.
Cross-device tracking
Users often interact with an app ecosystem through more than one device. For example, users might interact with an eCommerce app through both a native app and a web browser, or view media content on a web browser, a native app, or a Roku channel.
Many apps will want to track events and lifetime value for a user across all platforms, but others will prefer to keep data for each platform separate. IDSync allows mParticle to support both use cases, and to harness 3rd party data to decisively link data generated from y",11,guides_idsync_use-cases_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/use-cases/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/use-cases/,"our apps with data from other sources, like CRM Feeds.
Cross-app tracking
Your product ecosystem may be spread not just across multiple platforms, but also multiple apps. Needs for tracking users across multiple apps will vary depending on your business model. For example, a gaming organization might publish dozens of individual games and want to track their user’s LTV across all their apps. By creating workspaces for each app group under the same mParticle account, you can allow them to share a pool of users, and create only one profile per known user, no matter how many of your apps they use.
Alternatively, you might wish to define different groups of users for different apps within the same ecosystem. For example, you might have one app for vendors and another for buyers, with a completely different set of metrics for each group. IDSync allows mParticle to support either use case.
Customer experience personalization
Personalization of customer experience (CX) is a top priority for m",12,guides_idsync_use-cases_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/use-cases/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/use-cases/,"arketers. Personalization reduces friction and increases conversions by presenting relevant in-context content that increases customer awareness, engagement, and satisfaction. The Immutable Identity Setting enables marketers to use the mParticle Profile API to get the most up-to-date real-time user identities, device identities, user attributes, and audience memberships. The Profile API uses either an identifier with Immutable Identity set or the mParticle Identifier to match a user profile. Additionally, IDSync Search allows marketers to query User Profiles by any known identifier, such as email, mobile phone, or device identity, and return all matched user identity values including the mParticle ID. The mParticle ID can then be used with Profile API to get the values necessary to personalize the customer experience.
Privacy compliance
The ability to provide evidence that demonstrates that your organization is in regulatory compliance is important to every Chief Privacy Officer and co",13,guides_idsync_use-cases_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/use-cases/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/idsync/use-cases/,"rporate information security executive. GDPR and CCPA data privacy controls and traceability are core to mParticle’s user profile data policies. In addition, the IDSync Search capability can verify that a matching User Profile exists. It can also be used after a GDPR or CCPA User Profile Delete Request has been processed, to validate that the process has completed successfully and thereby validate compliance.
Mutable identities
Different user identifiers have different lifespans and degrees of specificity. A Customer ID or a social media ID permanently identify a single user, while an IP Address or Session ID may not be sufficient to identify a single user and can change at any time. Other identifiers fall somewhere in between. Email addresses, for example, do identify a single user, but a user may change their email address over time. IDSync gives you the tools to update identifiers for a User Profile without losing that user’s history.

Introduction
The purpose of this guide is to walk you through the basic steps of setting up mParticle in your app, unlocking core functionality, and troubleshooting common issues. Along the way, you’ll cover some important concepts you need to understand to be successful with mParticle.
This is not a complete guide to all of mParticle’s features and capabilities. If you already know your way around mParticle and you’re looking for in-depth docs, head to our Developers or Guides sections.
Most of this guide ",9,guides_getting-started_create-an-input.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input,"is aimed at users of the mParticle Dashboard, but to follow along with the tutorials, you will need to set up the mParticle SDK in your iOS, Android or web app, so you may need support from a developer to complete some steps.
Examples
The tutorials in this guide follow the process of setting up mParticle in the mPTravel app: a mobile and web app that sells luxury travel packages to its users.
Later on in this guide, you’ll learn about sending data from mParticle to some of our many integration partners. As examples, the tutorials use services which are simple to set up and verify, and which offer a free account tier, so that you will be able follow the examples exactly if you wish. However, mParticle is agnostic about which integrations you choose and you can follow the same basic steps from this guide to implement any of our integrations.
Inputs and Outputs
One of the key functions of mParticle is to receive your data from wherever it originates, and send it wherever it needs to go. T",10,guides_getting-started_create-an-input.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input,"he sources of your data are inputs and the service or app where it is forwarded are outputs. A connection is a combination of an input and output.
Inputs include:
Apps or services built on any platform we support, such as iOS, Android, or Web. You can view the full list in SETUP > Inputs in the PLATFORMS tab.
Data feeds of any other data you want to send into mParticle. This could be data you have collected yourself or from a feed partner. Once configured, feed inputs are listed in SETUP > Inputs on the FEEDS tab.
Outputs may be configured for events, audiences, cookie syncs, or data subject requests depending on what the output supports. You can see the list of configured outputs in SETUP > Outputs or SETUP > Data Warehouses. Outputs include:
Analytics partners such as Indicative
Advertising partners such as Facebook
In-app messaging partners such as Braze
Data Warehouse partners, such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake
To get started with mParticle, you need some data,",11,guides_getting-started_create-an-input.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input," which means you need to create at least one input.
Create Access Credentials
The first thing you need to do is to to create a set of access credentials that will allow a client-side SDK or a server-side application to forward data to this workspace.
Login to your mParticle account. If you’re just getting started, your first workspace is created for you. The first screen you see is an overview of activity in the workspace. Since you haven’t yet sent any data, there’s nothing to report, so far.
Navigate to Setup > Inputs in the left column. Here you can see each platform type accepted by mParticle. Different platforms are associated with different sets of metadata, such as device identifiers, and most outputs only accept data from a limited set of platforms, so it is important to select the right platform. To capture data from your native Android app, choose Android. Just click the + next to your chosen platform.
Click Issue Keys.
Copy and save the generated Key and Secret.
About Access",12,guides_getting-started_create-an-input.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input," Credentials
mParticle labels the credentials you create for an integration the key and secret, but they are not exactly like an API key and secret, since you embed these credentials in the app. However, this is not the security risk that exposing API credentials would be:
The client-side key and secret can’t read data from the system.
You can block bad data to stop any traffic that doesn’t match the data you expect as defined in your schema.
Most anonymous client-server architectures, including Adobe, Braze, Firebase, Google Analytics, and Segment don’t have per-session or per-instance credentials, nor does mParticle.
Install and Initialize an mParticle SDK
You need a developer to help you install and initialize an SDK. See the Getting Started guides for the iOS, Android or Javascript SDKs to get set up before continuing.
Verify: Look for Incoming Data in the Live Stream
Navigate to Activity > Live Stream in the left column. The Live Stream lets you inspect all incoming data from your",13,guides_getting-started_create-an-input.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input," development environments. It’s an easy way to check that you have correctly initialized mParticle in your app. When you first open up the Live Stream, it will be empty, as we haven’t yet started sending data.
Start up a development build of your app (get a developer to help you if necessary). The mParticle SDKs automatically collect and forward data about installs and user sessions, so just by opening a development build of your app, you should start to see data in the Live Stream.
Advanced Platform Configuration Settings
For the iOS, Android, tvOS, and Web platforms, some advanced configuration settings are available. To change these settings, navigate to Setup > Inputs in the left column and select either iOS, Android, tvOS, or Web from the list of platforms.
Expand the Advanced Settings by clicking the + icon.
Restrict Device ID by Limit Ad Tracking
iOS, Android, and tvOS (Apple TV) devices allow users to limit the collection of advertising IDs. Advertising IDs are unique identifie",14,guides_getting-started_create-an-input.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input,"rs you may use to associate event and user data with a specific device. For both iOS and Android devices, if a user has not provided explicit consent to share their device’s advertising ID, then the value of that ID is set to an all-zero value.
By checking Restrict Device ID by Limit Ad Tracking, mParticle will not collect advertising IDs from users who have enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device.
Remember, mParticle will collect advertising IDs for both iOS and Android devices, regardless of whether or not a user has enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device. However, the IDs collected from users who have opted out will be all-zero values.
Following are descriptions of Apple and Google’s policies for device advertising IDs:
iOS Advertising IDs
After the release of iOS 14.5, Apple introduced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, which requires app developers to request users’ explicit consent to share their advertising IDs. If a user of your app has ",15,guides_getting-started_create-an-input.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input,"not provided this consent, Apple’s advertising ID (IDFA) will be set to all an all-zero value: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. Read more about Apple advertising identifiers in their documentation.
For more information about the ATT framework, visit the iOS 14 Guide.
Android Advertising IDs
Google allows Android users to opt out from sharing their devices’ advertising IDs. Similar to Apple’s policy, Google will set a user’s advertising ID (GAID or AAID) to an all-zero value if that user has opted out from sharing their ID. Read more about Google’s advertising identifiers in their documentation.
Collect Integration-Specific Identifiers
The Web SDK can collect integration-specific identifiers to enrich the user data forwarded to your connected outputs.
When Collect Integration-Specific Identifiers is checked, these integration-specific identifiers are collected and used to enrich your user data to help optimize the match rate of your audiences in downstream tools. Currently, these i",16,guides_getting-started_create-an-input.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input,"dentifiers include Facebook’s fbc and fbp fields.

Troubleshoot
If you don’t see data appearing in the Live Stream within the first few minutes after opening a development build:
Check that you have copied your Key and Secret correctly
Check that you have properly included the mParticle SDK in your project and it is correctly initialized. The necessary steps will differ depending on the platform. Check our iOS, Android and Web docs for more.

Add SDK Dependencies
mParticle’s Android SDK is powered by a “core” library, which supports mParticle’s server-side integrations and audience platform. You can add the core SDK via Maven Central or jCenter. Please follow the releases page on Github to stay up to date with the latest version.
Add the following dependencies to your app’s build.gradle:
dependencies {
implementation 'com.mparticle:android-core:5+'
//",9,developers_client-sdks_android_initialization_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/initialization/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/initialization/," Required for gathering Android Advertising ID (see below)
implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier:18.0.1'
// Recommended to query the Google Play install referrer
implementation 'com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer:1.0'
}
Google Play Services Ads
The Google Play Services Ads framework is necessary to collect the Android Advertising ID (also known as Google Advertising ID). AAID collection is required by all attribution and audience integrations, and many other integrations. Include the com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier artifact, a subset of Google Play Services. The SDK will use reflection to determine if the necessary API is present at runtime.
When apps target Android 13 or above, you need to declare a Google Play services permission in the manifest file as follows:
<uses-permission android:name=""com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID""/>
If your app does not declare this permission when targeting Android 13 or higher, the advert",10,developers_client-sdks_android_initialization_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/initialization/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/initialization/,"ising ID is automatically removed and replaced with a string of zeroes.
For more information, please check out this link: https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248?hl=en
Google Play Install Referrer
The Google Play “install referrer” string contains information for how the user arrived at your listing in Google Play prior to downloading your app. Collection of this information is recommended in order for attribution, deep linking, and analytics integrations to work properly. There are two ways to collect the install referrer string via mParticle:
(recommended) Add the com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer dependency to your application and the SDK will automatically gather it. This is the latest and most foolproof method
Collect the install referrer string and pass it to mParticle yourself, see the complete API reference for more information
If you're using any ""kits,"" mParticle takes care of forwarding the install referrer string to them regardless o",11,developers_client-sdks_android_initialization_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/initialization/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/initialization/,"f the method you choose above.
Play Install Referrer Library
Add the com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer library dependency to your app as in the example above and the Android SDK will automatically gather the install referrer string. This is the best way to collect the install referrer due to higher reliability than the intent broadcast. You can read more about the install referrer library here.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
If you’re integration push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging or the legacy Google Cloud Messaging, please see the Android push notification guide. If this is your first time instrumenting the mParticle SDK, we recommend continuing on and coming back to push notification instrumentation after completing the basic SDK integration below.
Initialize the SDK
You can configure the SDK with an MParticleOptions object and its respective builder class. At minimum you must supply your mParticle input key and secret via the credentials() builder API.
We recommend",12,developers_client-sdks_android_initialization_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/initialization/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/initialization/," initializing the SDK in the onCreate() method of your app’s Application class. If you prefer, you may initialize the SDK in an Activity class - as long as the SDK is initialized prior to any other SDK API calls.
JavaKotlin
//import mParticle
import com.mparticle.MParticle;
import com.mparticle.MParticleOptions;
public class ExampleApplication extends Application {
@Override
public void onCreate() {
super.onCreate();
MParticleOptions options = MParticleOptions.builder(this)
.credentials(""REPLACE ME WITH KEY"", ""REPLACE ME WITH SECRET"")
.build();
MParticle.start(options);
}
}
//import mParticle
import com.mparticle.MParticle
import com.mparticle.MParticleOptions
class ExampleApplication : Application() {
override fun onCreate() {
super.onCreate()
val options = MParticleOptions.builder(this)
.credentials(""REPLACE ME WITH KEY"", ""REPLACE ME WITH SECRET"")
.build()
MParticle.start(options)
}
}
Your Application.onCreate() should only initialize the SDK. The Android operating system will initia",13,developers_client-sdks_android_initialization_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/initialization/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/initialization/,"lize your Application class any time your app's BroadcastReceivers or Services are invoked. For this reason, it's not advised to log events, set user attributes, or invoke other APIs here - doing so will result in inflated active-user metrics.
Kit Integrations
Several integrations require additional client-side add-on libraries called “kits.” Some kits embed other SDKs, others just contain a bit of additional functionality. Kits are designed to feel just like server-side integrations; you enable, disable, filter, sample, and otherwise tweak kits completely from the mParticle platform UI. Reference the kit documentation for information on kits.
Initial identification request
The SDK will automatically initialize with the most recent user identities from the most recently active user. You may override this by including an identity request via the identify API of your MParticleOptions object:
JavaKotlin
MParticleOptions.Builder options = MParticleOptions.builder(this);
options.identify(id",14,developers_client-sdks_android_initialization_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/initialization/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/initialization/,"entityRequest);
var options = MParticleOptions.builder(this)
options.identify(identityRequest)
See the IDSync documentation for more information on building a complete identity request.Was this page helpful?YesNoLast Updated: February 27, 2025© 2025 mParticle, Inc.

When a consumer/data subject exercises their rights, they create a data subject request (DSR). This page will guide you through mParticle’s support for handling DSRs for both GDPR and CCPA.
This page does not provide legal advice, only a description of how to use mPa",9,guides_data-subject-requests_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,"rticle’s compliance-related features. The information provided here is solely for understanding and using mParticle features and is not intended to be legally compliant or specific enough for compliance.
This document uses GDPR language and terminology for simplicity.
mParticle provides data privacy controls to help you comply with consent and data sale opt-out requirements.
Roles
The GDPR defines three entities involved in data collection, with different rights and responsibilities:
Data Subject - A person whose data is gathered. Generally a user of your app.
Data Controller - An entity gathering the data. mParticle provides tools for Data Controllers to fulfill their obligations under the GDPR.
Data Processor - An entity that handles or stores data for the Data Controller. Under the GDPR, mParticle acts as a Data Processor.
Similarly, the CCPA defines:
Consumer - Similar to the GDPR’s definition of data subject, geographic requirements notwithstanding.
Businesses - Similar to the GDP",10,guides_data-subject-requests_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,"R’s definition of data controller.
Service provider - Similar to GDPR’s definition of data processor.
Rights of Data Subjects
The GDPR defines some rights of Data Subjects, including:
The right to have data concerning them erased. Also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’.
The right to access data concerning them.
The right to portability of data concerning them, for transfer to another controller.
The CCPA defines that consumers have rights of:
The right to request the data saved concerning them.
The right to request any data collected from the consumer be deleted.
OpenDSR Request Framework
mParticle is a collaborator on the OpenDSR framework, which provides a simple format for Data Controllers and Data Processors to collaborate towards compliance with requests from their Data Subjects to honor the above rights. This framework was formerly known as OpenGDPR; it was renamed in early 2020 to include CCPA support.
To find out more about OpenDSR, read the full spec on the Github page.
mPa",11,guides_data-subject-requests_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,"rticle’s OpenDSR implementation handles three types of DSRs: “Erasure”, “Access” and “Portability”.
Note that this documentation only covers how mParticle's role as a Data Processor is fulfilled. Most Data Controllers have more than one Data Processor and will need to work with all of them to fulfill Data Subject requests.
General Request Workflow
Each DSR follows the same basic workflow:
The data subject submits a DSR to the data controller.
The data controller must log, authenticate and verify the request. If they choose to accept the request, the data controller forwards a request to mParticle in its role as a data processor. The request provides:
One or more identities for the data subject
The type of request: “Erasure”, “Access” or “Portability”
The time the data subject submitted the request
An optional list of status callback URLs
On receipt of the request, mParticle sets the status of the request to “Pending” and sends a status callback request to all URLs listed in the origina",12,guides_data-subject-requests_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,"l request. This callback includes an expected completion time for the request, which is calculated as: the time it will be scheduled for processing plus 48 hours to ensure the job completes in time.
The Data Controller can check the status of the request at any time.
When the request is complete, mParticle sends a status callback request to all URLs listed in the original request. For Erasure requests, this callback will simply confirm that the request has been fulfilled. For Access and Portability requests, a download link will be provided.
For Access and Portability requests, the download link remains valid for 7 days. Attempting to access the download link after that time will result in a 410 Gone HTTP response.
This workflow can be managed in mParticle UI or programmatically via the OpenDSR API.
Identifying affected user data
mParticle stores data against user profiles, each identified by an mParticle ID (MPID). To respond to DSRs, mParticle first matches identities in the DSR agai",13,guides_data-subject-requests_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,"nst observed user profiles. This is handled the same way as mParticle’s regular IDSync process: provided identities are resolved to MPIDs to identify affected user data.
Data subject requests submitted without a login ID will not be fulfilled for known profiles that have an associated login ID. For example, if you submit a data subject request that only includes the device ID for a user, mParticle will not be able to find the correct profile to fulfill the request.
When finding the correct profile for a DSR, mParticle follows the same identity resolution process used for general identification requests made to IDSync (the mParticle identity management system).
The exact profiles returned for a data subject request depend on the specific user identifiers supplied with the DSR and the identity strategy configured for your account.
All DSR requests are scoped to a single workspace by API authentication. If you need to apply a DSR to multiple workspaces, please submit it within each worksp",14,guides_data-subject-requests_.txt

Data Subject Request Settings
To get started, enable GDPR and/or CCPA compliance features on your workspace from Workspace Settings > Workspace > Regulation. This will allow you to see the DSR UI. mParticle will honor all requests received via API even with these features disabled.
You have the option to include a copy of the live user profile in access/portability requests. Navigate to Privacy > Privacy Settings to include a copy of the users profile with GDPR and/or CCPA DSRs. This is for clients whose privacy teams determine that this is required for compliance. The profiles will include: devices, identities, audience memberships, user attributes and calculated attributes. By default, profiles are not included.
To see the pages under the Privacy tab, you must be in the Support role. To see or make changes in the pages under the Privacy tab, you must be in the Admin & Compliance or Compliance role.

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,"Particle:
Develop a strategy for accepting Data Subject Requests
As a Data Processor, mParticle will match user profiles for a Data Subject Request based on any identities we are given. As a Data Controller, it is your responsibility to determine how to accept and forward Data Subject Requests in order to best meet your GDPR responsibilities and manage risk. This decision should be managed in conjunction with your Identity Strategy.
You also have the option of using the Identity API to identify for yourself the MPIDs you wish to include in the request and submitting them directly, rather than letting mParticle match IDs for you.
Be sure to consult your internal privacy and compliance experts when determining your strategy for accepting and forwarding Data Subject Requests.
Supported Request Types
Erasure
After mParticle receives an erasure request, a 7 day waiting period starts. This waiting period gives you the opportunity to cancel a pending erasure request before it is initiated.
Af",16,guides_data-subject-requests_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,"ter the 7 day waiting period, any pending erasures are initiated. Once begun, it may take up to 14 days before the erasure is complete. For each completed erasure request, mParticle sends a callback to any specified URLs indicating that the request has been fulfilled.
Erasure request waiting period
By default, erasure requests are completed between 7 and 21 days after being received by mParticle. The initial 7 day waiting period provides an opportunity to cancel a pending erasure request before it is carried out.
To skip the initial 7 day waiting period when submitting a data subject erasure request to mParticle, check the option labeled Skip waiting period in the New Data Subject Request modal.
Skipping the waiting period shortens the request cancellation window. This reduces the total time required to complete an erasure request to between 1 and 14 days after it is received by mParticle.
If you wish to remove users from audiences or from event forwarding during the waiting period, se",17,guides_data-subject-requests_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,"t a user attribute and apply audience criteria and/or forwarding rules to exclude them.
Most privacy regulations simply require an acknowledgement of a request within an initial time frame. Fulfillment timeframes for requests are typically more generous as they may require follow-up to validate additional details. We recommend consulting the requirements of your privacy regulation to understand your obligations.
What data is deleted?
In response to a data subject erasure request, mParticle deletes the data it stored, such as historical event batches, audience data, and profiles.
A delete request will also not prevent additional data concerning the subject from being received and processed by mParticle. If the data subject wishes to prevent all future data processing, they will likely need to take additional steps, for example, ceasing to use your service/app.
Access / Portability
Access and Portability requests are treated exactly the same way, as follows:
mParticle identifies the MPID",18,guides_data-subject-requests_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,"s that match the request.
Just after midnight each Monday and Thursday, mParticle searches for data related to each MPID, including the user profile and historical event batches.
mParticle compiles the data into a single text file. This data includes device identities, user identities, user attributes (including calculated attributes), as well as current audience memberships.
mParticle sends a callback to any specified Callback URLs indicating that the request has been completed. The callback will contain a secure download link to the text file containing the Subject’s data.
If you submit an access and portability request for more than one profile using multiple MPIDs, the data for every profile returned will be included in a single file. Since the resolution process for DSRs is the same as the process for IDSync, an access and portability request that includes only a device ID will not return any profiles that are protected by a login ID.
For example, imagine that a user opens your ap",19,guides_data-subject-requests_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,"p and is tracked with an anonymous profile, but they do not create an account with a login ID. Later, a different user on the same device opens your app and logs in with a login ID. If you submit an access and portability request but only supply the device ID, then only the data for the anonymous user will be returned.
Access / Portability requests are processed every three days on the start of Mondays and Thursdays.
Access / Portability Response Format
The data gathered in response to an access or portability request will be delivered in a .zip folder containing many .jsonl files (JSON Lines format).
The zip may contain:
profile.jsonl: A file that contains the live profile at the time of the request. This includes: device identities, user identities, current audience memberships and user attributes (including calculated attributes).
one or more additional .jsonl files: These results are split into many files to avoid a single, large file to make them easier to transmit and process. Co",20,guides_data-subject-requests_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,"ntrollers are encouraged to re-process the files as they see fit. These files contain the event batches sent to mParticle. Each line of the data files represents a complete mParticle event batch. See our JSON Reference for a guide to the event batch format.
empty.txt:
A file which indicates that mParticle found one or more MPIDs associated with the identities in the request, but that there is no data available for them.
Note that if no records can be found matching the identities in the request, the request for the zip file returns a 404 error.
A sample portability response can be downloaded here.
Managing Data Subject Requests in the mParticle Dashboard
In addition to the OpenDSR API, users with the Compliance or Admin and Compliance role can create, delete and monitor DSRs directly in the mParticle Dashboard.

To view details about a request, click the Request ID number.
Forwarding Data Subject Requests for Erasure
You can configure mParticle to forward Data Subject Requests (DSRs) for erasure with one or more integrations.
This detail UI for a data subject request for erasure shows the forwarding status for a request that is being forwarded to three different outputs.
The forwarding status field contains different values, depending on the situation:
Pending means that a request has been queued for forwarding, but hasn’t been forwarded yet.
Skipped means that a request for forwarding has been skipped because mParticle could not find suitable identities to forward, either from the original request or the user profile.
Sent means that a request was forwarded and an acknowledgement of the request to delete the user from the integration was received by mParticle.
Failed means that an attempt to forward the request was made, but an error occurred.
Not Sent means that the request",22,guides_data-subject-requests_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/," was not forwarded, because the request was made using an older version of the DSR API. You must upgrade to the DSR API v3 in order to forward DSR erasure requests.
In addition to the forwarding status, the identities that were forwarded are also shown. mParticle determines which identities to forward based on the identities supplied in the original request, the identity resolution strategy, and what identities each output supports:
When a single generic identity type (such as email address) is submitted in the erasure request OR
When multiple generic identities of different types (such as email address and device ID) are submitted in the erasure request and:
mParticle resolves it to a single user profile: mParticle enriches the request with all IDs found on the corresponding user profile. mParticle will include all identities supported by the output in the forwarded request.
mParticle resolves it to multiple user profiles: mParticle will try to resolve it to a single user profile foll",23,guides_data-subject-requests_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,"owing your Identity resolution strategy. mParticle then enriches the request with all IDs found on the corresponding user profile. mParticle will include all identities supported by the output in the forwarded request.
mParticle cannot resolve it to any user profile: The request may still be forwarded if the vendor supports the ID type provided in the original DSR request.
When a single MPID is submitted in the erasure request and:
mParticle resolves it to a single user profile: mParticle enriches the request with all IDs found on the corresponding user profile. mParticle will include identities supported by the output in the forwarded request.
mParticle cannot resolve it to any user profile and nothing will be forwarded.
In the case where the data in a user profile does not match what was provided in the original erasure request, mParticle will use the information from the original erasure request as the source of truth to process and forward the request.
Once a request is forwarded, ",24,guides_data-subject-requests_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-subject-requests/,"mParticle can’t guarantee that data is ultimately deleted by the integration partner, so confirm that each vendor fulfills the request.
If an integration supports forwarding erasure requests, the integration documentation contains a section “Data Subject Request Forwarding for Erasure” and that section contains specific instructions and information about which identities are forwarded.
To find all the integrations that support forwarding erasure requests, visit Integrations.

Version 2 will no longer be updated. Version 3 requires that your account be enabled for IDSync. We are currently in the process of migrating accounts. Check with your Customer Service Manger before migrating if you are unsure. Please see Upgrade to Version 3 of the plugin for migration assistance.
Plugin Setup
Download and import the plugin package to get started:
Navigate to the releases page, download mParticle.unitypackage
Open an existing Unity project or create a new project
Open the package directly, or import it to your project by selecting Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package…
iOS Setup
mParticle.unitypackage contains the mParticle Apple SDK as a static library and the required headers which will be automatically imported into your project.
Automated Xcode configuration
mParticle.unitypackage includes PostprocessBuildPlayer_mParticle that automates several Xcode project configuration steps that are required to successfully build your application for the iOS platf",10,developers_client-sdks_unity_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/unity/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/unity/getting-started/,"orm. During the build process, Unity will locate and execute this script.
Starting with Unity 5.3, post-process scripts are not run automatically. In those cases, the script will be run by mParticleBuildPostprocessor.cs instead.
Manual Xcode configuration
You can also configure Xcode manually by adding the required frameworks specified in the Apple SDK’s manual installation guide.
Android Setup
mParticle.unitypackage contains the mParticle core AAR artifact which will be automatically imported into your project.
Upgrade to Version 3 of the Plugin
Version 3 of the Unity Plugin contains breaking changes from version 2.x, including new methods to support mParticle’s IDSync features and the deprecation of older methods for managing users.
Identity and User Attributes
Previously, current user identities and attributes were set at the level of the device and included with any outgoing uploads. This approach has been deprecated in favor of more explicit user management via the Identity API. Y",11,developers_client-sdks_unity_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/unity/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/unity/getting-started/,"ou may include an Identity request when you initialize the native iOS and Android SDKs. If you do not specify a request, identify will be called with the most recently stored user identities. You should also update the current User Identity at appropriate points in your app lifecycle, such as Login and Logout. See Identity for more.
UserAliasHandler
When transitioning from one user to another, usually as a previously anonymous user creates an account and becomes a known user, some Identity Strategies will alias the old anonymous profile to the new known one. The UserAliasHandler gives you the option to copy over attributes currently held in local storage to the new user profile.
The MParticleUser Object
The SetUserIdentity() and SetUserAttribute() methods are deprecated as at version 3. Instead, the current user, as determined by the Identity API is exposed via MParticle.Instance.Identity.CurrentUser. The user object provides methods to check the MPID of the current user, modify the us",12,developers_client-sdks_unity_getting-started_.txt

If you are a partner looking to integrate with mParticle, please follow these instructions.
Base URL
The base URL for the Events API varies depending on the data localization region for your mParticle account:

Authentication
The mParticle Events API can be authenticated with basic authentication in either of two ways:
If your HTTP client supports basic authentication, use your API key for “username” and your secret for “password”.
You can manually set the Authorization header in calls to the Events API by including your key and secret encoded together:
2.1 Concatenate your key and secret together using a colon (:) separating the two: example-api-key:example-api-secret
2.2 Base64 with UTF-8 encode the result: ZXhhbXBsZS1hcGkta2V5OmV4YW1wbGUtYXBpLXNlY3JldA==
2.3 Prefix the encoded string with the authorization method, including a space: Basic ZXhhbXBsZS1hcGkta2V5OmV4YW1wbGUtYXBpLXNlY3JldA==
2.4 Set the resulting string as the authorization header in your HTTP requests: Authorization: Basic ZXhhbXBsZS1hcGkta2V5OmV4YW1wbGUtYXBpLXNlY3JldA==
JSON format
The following examples demonstrate how to execute a general request to the Events API, however, the size of an e",10,developers_apis_http_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/apis/http/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/apis/http/,"xample request body exercising every available property and parameter is too large to include. For a complete reference of the Events API schema that lists each property and parameter, see the JSON reference.
Open API spec
Use the Open API (previously known as Swagger) specification or similar tools to generate helper SDKs (using Swagger Codegen or OpenAPI Generator) for the Events API:
Events API Open API Spec
Rate limits
mParticle imposes default service limits on server-to-server data transfers using the Events API. For the specific limits, see Default Service Limits.
Maximizing performance
When sending large amounts of data to the Events API, use efficient batching strategies to prevent drops in performance.
Remember that one event batch includes an array than can contain one or more events. If you are tracking a large number of events that are all triggered by a single user, combine as many events as possible in a single batch based on a predetermined rate, such as a set number of",11,developers_apis_http_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/apis/http/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/apis/http/," events per timespan or a set number of events per user. Sending one batch for each event incurs a noticeable drop in performance.
You can further reduce your number of requests by grouping up to 100 event batches for multiple users and sending them to the /bulkevents endpoint.
Event batches require the following:
Each batch must contain data for only one user
Each batch must not exceed 128kb
A request to /bulkevents must contain no more than 100 batches
Exceeding these limits results in throttling.
Upload event data

Upload multiple event batches
POST https://s2s.{pod}.mparticle.com/v2/bulkevents
This path accepts a JSON array of event batches.
See our JSON documentation for additional information.
You may not send more than 100 EVENT DATA items per request.
If some event batches succeed and some event batches fail, you still receive a 202 Accepted response.
Don’t use this URL to upload historical data older than 30 days, as this could impact downstream processes such as audience calculation. To upload historical data older than 30 days, use the historical endpoint.

Upload a historical event batch
POST https://s2s.{pod}.mparticle.com/v2/bulkevents/historical
This path accepts the same JSON payload as /v2/bulkevents and should be used to upload historical data more than 30 days old. Data forwarded to the historical endpoint is subject to special requirements and is processed differently.
Historical data requirements
A batch received by the historical data endpoint will ",14,developers_apis_http_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/apis/http/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/apis/http/,"not be processed if any of the following are true:
The batch contains no events,
Any event in the batch does not contain the timestamp_unixtime_ms property,
The value of any timestamp_unixtime_ms is less than 72 hours old.
Historical data processing
The historical API endpoint behaves nearly identically to the events and bulkevents endpoints with one key difference: data is not forwarded to connected event and data warehouses.

Prerequisites
Before you start this activity, you should have already:
Created an input
Started to capture some basic data points
Outputs
Outputs are mParticle’s term for the services where we forward your data. Outputs are also referred to as “integrations”. Outputs come in two types: “event”, and “audience”. Audiences are covered in the next part of this guide. This section will show you how to set up an eve",9,guides_getting-started_connect-an-event-output_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output/,"nt output.
Example - Connect an Output to Analytics
mParticle has over a hundred event outputs, and the connection process for each is similar. This tutorial creates a connection to Analytics as an example. You can follow the same steps with a different output, or create a free Analytics account to follow along exactly.
Find Analytics in the Directory
Click Directory in the sidebar, and search for Analytics.
Click the Analytics tile to display Output: Event Configuration.
Enter the configuration information:
Enter a configuration name.
Leave the box checked to use the same settings for Development & Production.
Select a field as the user identity field. Leave the default if you’re not sure what to choose.
Enter the Analytics API key which you can find in the Analytics project settings.
Remember to save your new output configuration.
Create the Connection
Now that you have both an input and an output set up, it’s time to connect them:
Click Connections > Connect, and select the input yo",10,guides_getting-started_connect-an-event-output_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output/,"u’ve already set up.
Click Connect Output.
Select your Analytics configuration.
Complete the Connection Settings, different for each output. For Analytics you can leave the default selections.
Set the status to Active and click Save.
Verify: Check that data is arriving in Analytics
Once you have enabled the connection, open up the development build of your app again and create a few more events. Each output service displays the data it receives differently. For Analytics, you can view real-time data in the Debug Console.
Troubleshoot
If you don’t see data arriving in the output service, navigate to Data Master > Live Stream and select Message Direction Outbound.
If you see messages in the outbound Live Stream, but none in the output service:
You may just need to wait. For most event outputs, mParticle forwards information in close to real time. However, there are factors which can slow down processing and the amount of time it takes for data to become visible in an output service’s das",11,guides_getting-started_connect-an-event-output_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output/,"hboard can be different for each service.
Navigate to Activity > System Alerts and see if there are any errors noted for the output you want to troubleshoot. The error type may give you a clue as to what is wrong.
If the previous step doesn’t resolve the issue:
Check all of your Configuration and Connection settings. Make sure that all settings are correct, especially any access credentials, such as Project or App IDs, API Key & Secret, etc.
It is common for a particular output service to require certain identifiers or other data points to be present to allow data to be forwarded. As an example, the Google Ads output requires information about a user’s device, including the Device Advertising ID, in order to construct a User Agent Header. If the Device Advertising ID is not present, no data can be sent. Check the docs for the output service and make sure you’re sending all the required information.
If there are no outgoing messages in the Live Stream, then mParticle is not attempting t",12,guides_getting-started_connect-an-event-output_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output/,"o send any data to the output service. Some possible reasons for this include:
Not all outputs support every platform or accept every event type. The Directory shows a list of available platforms and supported event types for each output. Make sure the data you are trying to send is supported.
mParticle allows you to filter your data for each output. Check the Data Filter to make sure you haven’t turned off the data points you’re trying to send.
Next steps
By now you should be successfully forwarding data to at least one event output. Some additional resources you might want to look at include:
One of the key benefits of mParticle is the power to collect data once and forward it to as many output services as you wish. Browse the Integrations section of our docs to learn more about the different services mParticle can forward your data to.
Most event outputs work by forwarding data server-side via the output partner’s HTTP API. However, some outputs require extra client-side code to be ",13,guides_getting-started_connect-an-event-output_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output/,"added to your native app, to allow data to be sent directly from your app to the output service. These integrations are called “embedded kits”. You can read more about them in the iOS and Android documentation.
Sending web data to an output usually works a little differently from native. If you’re using mParticle on the web, read our guide to Working with Web Data.
Next up, you will learn about the second category of mParticle data by creating an audience.Was this page helpful?YesNoLast Updated: February 27, 2025© 2025 mParticle, Inc.

Examples
Use audiences to create sophisticated segments powered by both rules and machine learning.
Drive User Engagement Through Intelligent Segmentation
Let’s say you want to target users who installed your app to increase their engagement. There are two approaches to accomplishing this using Audiences:
Rules-based: Taking this strategy, you would use audience criteria to build a customer segment that aligns with your target characteristics, like users who installed your app in the last 72 hours with fewer than three sessions.
AI-powered: Using a predictive approach, you c",10,guides_personalization_audiences_overview.txt

Once the Predictive Attribute has been generated, you could use it as an audience criteria to select users who are statistically most likely to engage with your app.
No matter which approach you take, you can easily forward your audience to push notification and email partners.
Once these audience connections are established, mParticle instantiates a corresponding audiences both partners.
No coding is necessary.
Drive app downloads
Let’s say you want to find more users like your currently highly engaged users and run an app download campaign in Facebook against that target audience. You start by defining your highly engaged users, using whatever criteria is important to you: lifetime value metrics, session activity, event activity, or any other data points you capture.

From there you can leverage the custom audiences like any other custom audience in Facebook.
Because we want to target users that look like our highly engaged users, we will create a Facebook lookalike audience from our highly engaged user audience and run a Facebook app install campaign that targets that lookalike audience.Was this page helpful?YesNoLast Updated: February 27, 2025© 2025 mParticle, Inc.

This includes limits around the length of individual data points, such as event names, how fast mParticle can receive data, and how many unique data points a workspace or account can have.
The tables below list mParticle’s Default Limits. Enterprise customers should contact their Customer Success Manager for custom limits.
mParticle can receive data across many channels,",9,guides_default-service-limits_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/default-service-limits/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/default-service-limits/," and limits are not always enforced in the same way for each channel. Where appropriate, the details section of each table describes how limits affect SDK data - received from mParticle’s native SDKs - and S2S or ‘server-to-server’ data. S2S data includes data received via the Events API, and from partner feeds.
Note that output services often have their own limits, which can differ from mParticle's. When planning your implementation, check the documentation for your output services in the Integration Center to make sure you are complying with their limits.

API throttling
mParticle APIs have two types of rate limits in place to protect mParticle’s servers from high demand:
Spe",16,guides_default-service-limits_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/default-service-limits/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/default-service-limits/,"ed: limits the rate of traffic.
Acceleration: limits the rate of increase of traffic.
You can configure your mParticle integration to respond programmatically to prevent data loss according to the 429 response header you receive.
Throttled resources include a percentage representation of your current total usage in 2xx response headers. These percentage-used headers allow you to modify your request speed or acceleration to prevent exceeding a rate limit.
429 rate limit exceeded
An API request that exceeds the rate (speed) limit of a resource receives a 429 response and a header with the format:
X-mp-rate-limit-exceeded: ""LIMIT""
where ""LIMIT"" is the ID of the source of the limit as described in the table below:
Value
Description
""org""
A limit applied to an entire organization.
""account""
A limit applied to an account ID within a parent organization.
""app""
A limit applied to an app ID within a parent organization.
""feed""
A limit applied to a feed ID within a parent organization.
""workspac",17,guides_default-service-limits_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/default-service-limits/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/default-service-limits/,"e""
A limit applied to a workspace ID within a parent organization.
""system""
A limit applied at an mParticle system level across multiple organizations.
""acceleration""
An acceleration limit that can be applied to any of the speed limits listed above.
An API request that exceeds any applicable acceleration limit receives a 429 response and a header with the format:
X-mp-rate-limit-exceeded: “acceleration”
2xx percentage used
Rate limited endpoints return an X-mp-rate-limit-percentage-used header with 2xx responses including the percentage of the limit used. If a resource has multiple limits, the response header includes the greatest consumption percentage of all applicable speed and acceleration limits, omitting any user-based limits.
For example, if a request is not throttled and is subject to both a speed and acceleration limit, and the current consumption is 92% of the speed limit and 50% of the acceleration limit, then the header lists the consumption of the speed limit because it is",18,guides_default-service-limits_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/default-service-limits/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/default-service-limits/," higher than the current acceleration limit usage:
X-mp-rate-limit-percentage-used: 92
Recommended actions
If you receive a 429 response for exceeding a speed limit, reduce the frequency of your requests. Use exponential back-off with jitter and respect the RetryAfter value which is a non-negative decimal integer indicating the number of seconds to delay your request.
If you receive a 429 response for exceeding an acceleration limit, you can still submit requests but you should slow the increase of your request speed. Use exponential back-off with jitter when determining the new frequency of your requests.Was this page helpful?YesNoLast Updated: February 27, 2025© 2025 mParticle, Inc.

mParticle provides several SDKs and APIs allowing you to collect data from a variety of sources, like a mobile app, web app, or data feeds from other SaaS providers.
You can collect two types of data with mParticle:
Event data: data that describes what your users are doing
User data: data that describes who your users are

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/web/overview/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/web/overview/,"ow to integrate the Web SDK from start to finish
To demonstrate how mParticle works, you will learn how to track basic event data like page views and purchase events in a web app using the mParticle web SDK. Then, you will learn how to send that data to a webhook. You will also learn how to manage your data quality by creating a data plan.
mParticle is extremely flexible. There are thirteen SDKs for specific platforms like web, iOS, and Android, in addition to several APIs. mParticle also provides over 250 integrations with data warehouse, analytics, and marketing automation tools.
To keep your first steps with mParticle quick and easy, this tutorial uses the web SDK and a sample ecommerce app built using React called The Higgs Shop.
This is a technical tutorial for developers. If you aren’t a developer, you can find a general introduction to mParticle in the Platform Guide.
About the Web SDK
mParticle’s Web SDK supports commonly used web browsers, connected TVs, and other client-side ",10,developers_quickstart_web_overview_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/web/overview/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/web/overview/,"environments using JavaScript and TypeScript.
By initializing the Web SDK in your app, you gain access to useful methods you can call in your app’s code to send events and user data to mParticle.
Prerequisites
Access to an mParticle instance
In order to begin sending data from your app to mParticle, you will need access to an mParticle account and an API key.

This tutorial demonstrates how mParticle works using The Higgs Shop, a sample web application built using React.
Open your terminal or command prompt, and clone the web sample app repository on GitHub.
Install the sample app
While in your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root folder of the web sample app: /mparticle-sample-apps/mparticle-web-sample-apps/core-sdk-samples/higgs-shop-sample-app
If you don’t have Node.js or npm installed, install them now. Optionally, you may also install Node Version Manager (nvm) which is a helpful tool for installing and managing different versions of No",11,developers_quickstart_web_overview_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/web/overview/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/web/overview/,"de.
Install the sample app’s dependencies with npm install
Open the folder /higgs-shop-sample-app in your IDE or text editor. Rename the file .env.sample to .env. We will replace the environment variable REACT_APP_MPARTICLE_API_KEY with the API Key in step 5
To run the sample app from your computer, run npm start. This will start a development server before automatically opening The Higgs Shop in a new browser window.
It may take up to 2 minutes to launch the sample app.
Since we haven’t added our API key to the sample app’s config file yet, we will receive a warning message. We will add our API key in the next step.
For now, ignore the API key warning and close the page and stop the development server in your terminal or command prompt. In the next step, we’ll create and add our API key before restarting the sample app.

General Settings
Time Zone
The time zone setting determines the display time zone for all events within the project. All new projects default to (GMT+00:00) UTC (00:00). Note, only one time zone may be selected per project.
You are able to set up queries to be in a time zone that is not in your project time zone: The time zone selector is located in the top right corner of the query builder within each tool.
Date Format
The date format setting determines the display style for dates in Analytics. Dates are commonly found along the x-axis of query results. There are three options for date format: US MM/DD/YYYY, European DD/MM/YYYY, or ISO YYYY-MM-DD. All new projects default to US MM/DD/YYYY.
Currency Format
The currency format setting allows you to change the currency and symbol displayed for all Revenue results in Analytics.
To use the Revenue event, you must compl",10,guides_analytics_settings_.txt

IP Address Collection
If your project is integrated using the Analytics SDK, then the IP Address Collection setting appears in your project settings. You may enable or disable the collection of IP address information for your project. All new projects default to enabled.
Note: IP geolocation tracking is restricted under the Chil",11,guides_analytics_settings_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/analytics/settings/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/analytics/settings/,"d Protection Regulation (COPPA). Please ensure that you have disabled this within any project that contains data from online services directed toward children 13 years of age or younger. Analytics reserves the right to disable IP address collection if we suspect any violation, intentional or otherwise, of this regulation.
Public Sharing
Permit the sharing of embedded widgets, dashboard links, and scheduled reports externally.
AI Features
Enable or disable AI-assisted features including Assisted Analysis.
Teammates
View and modify all of the teammates in your organization. Users are listed with their name, role, status, and last login date.
Project Owners and Admins may change project member roles by clicking on the downward arrow within the role tab.
Data Sources
The Data Sources section displays a summary of the active and inactive data sources for your project, including the name, type, and date that event data was last seen (or received). A green dot indicates that the project recei",12,guides_analytics_settings_.txt

A red dot indicates that the project has not received data from this data source recently. A gray dot indicates that there is no information available about the status of this integration.
You are able to add a new data source to the project by clicking on New Data Source on the top right. This brings you to the Connect Your Data screen.
You may also view all data sources within an organization by accessing Data Sources within Organization settings. This will display data sources across all projects.
Data warehouse users may also view the specifics of their data warehouse integration by selecting Edit Details.
Scheduled Reports
Project Settings also contains a tool to manage Scheduled Reports. The table shows when reports were created and by which user, and the three-dot menu on the right allows editing of the underlying dashboard, as well as the features of the report itself. See our Reports documentation for more details.
Data Filters
If your ",13,guides_analytics_settings_.txt

Installation
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-mparticle
Grab your mParticle key and secret from your app’s dashboard.
iOS
Install the SDK using CocoaPods:
$ # Update your Podfile to depend on the latest version of 'mParticle-Apple-SDK'
$ pod install
The mParticle SDK is initialized by calling the startWithOptions method within the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: delegate call. Preferably the location of ",9,developers_client-sdks_cordova_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/cordova/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/cordova/getting-started/,"the initialization method call should be one of the last statements in the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:. The startWithOptions method requires an options argument containing your key and secret and an initial Identity request.
Note that it is imperative for the SDK to be initialized in the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method. Other parts of the SDK rely on the UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification notification to function properly. Failing to start the SDK as indicated will impair it. Also, please do not use GCD’s dispatch_async to start the SDK.
Swift
import mParticle_Apple_SDK
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
// Override point for customization after application launch.
let mParticleOptions = MParticleOptions(key: ""<<<App Key Here>>>"", secret: ""<<<App Secret Here>>>"")

mParticleOptions.onIdentifyComplete = { (apiResult, error) in

}
//Start the SDK
MParticle.sharedInstance().start(with: mParticleOptions)

}
Objective-C
With recent changes in Swift support for static libraries and React Native’s preference for the traditional CocoaPods and static libraries delivery mechanism, we recommend against setting use_frameworks! in your Podfile.
#import <mParticle-Apple-SDK/mParticle.h>
#import ""mParticle.h""
Next, you’ll need to start the SDK:
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
MParticleOptions *mParticleOptions = [MParticleOptions optionsWithKey:@""REPLACE ME""
secret:@""REPLACE ME""];

mParticleOptions.identifyRequest = request;
mParticleOptions.onIdentifyComplete = ^(MPIdentityApiResult * _Nullable apiResult, NSError * _Nullable error) {
NSLog(@""Identify complete. userId = %@ error = %@"", apiResult.user.userId, error);
};
[[MParticle sharedInstance] startWithOptions:mParticleOptions];
return YES;
}
Please see Identity for more information on supplying an MPIdentityApiRequest object during SDK initialization.
Android
Get your mParticle key and secret from your workspace’s dashboard and construct an MParticleOptions object.
Call start from the onCreate method of your app’s Application class. It’s crucial that the SDK be started here for proper session management. If you don’t already have an Application class, create it and then specify its fully-qualified name in the <application> tag of your app’s AndroidMa",12,developers_client-sdks_cordova_getting-started_.txt

.identifyTask(

Warning: It’s generally not a good idea to log events in your Application.onCreate(). Android may instantiate your Application class for a lot of reasons, in the background, while the user isn’t even using their device.

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event,"nceZendeskEventFeedQuadratic LabsEventZ2A DigitalEventAudienceQualtricsEventEventThis section describes the configuration settings necessary to activate mParticle’s event tracking integration with Facebook.
The event tracking integration enables conversion tracking for Facebook advertising campaigns.
Supported Features
Event Forwarding
Data Processing Notes
Facebook has limits around the number of unique event names and attributes their platform can process as noted here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/android/current/class/AppEventsLogger/
1000 unique event names
25 attributes per event
Between 2 and 40 characters in an event name and attribute
It may takes up to 24 hours to see refreshed stats in Facebook Analytics
Prerequisites
Event data from mParticle to Facebook is typically sent server side.
However, Web data can be sent client or server side based on your implementation and settings.
These different options require different settings:
iOS, tvOS, and Android - da",14,integrations_facebook_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event,"ta is sent S2S, and you’ll need your app’s Facebook Application ID and Application Secret
Data Feeds - data is sent S2S, and you’ll need your Facebook Pixel ID
Web - for client side kit, you’ll need your Facebook Pixel ID
Web - for S2S, you’ll need your Facebook Pixel ID and Facebook Marketing API Access Token. You also need to enable both the Use Pixel Server-Side Forwarding and Forward Web Requests Server Side settings.
Roku, Xbox, SmartTV, FireTV, Alexa - you’ll need your Facebook Pixel ID and Facebook Marketing API Access Token.
os_version is required for iOS/tvOS events. If os_version is not present, the event will be rejected and an error message will be shown in System Alerts.
Configuring Facebook Pixel Server-to-Server
You need to perform a few steps in Facebook to create a Facebook Pixel S2S connection.
Navigate to the Facebook Events Manager
Connect a New Data Source:
Select Web with a connection method of Conversions API.
Create an Access Token: Open the settings for the new",15,integrations_facebook_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event," Pixel Data Source, scroll to the Conversions API > Set up manually section and click Create Access Token. Follow the steps described and copy the Access Token for setup in mParticle.
Configuring Duplicate Events
Facebook recommends sending the same pixel event twice - once from the browser and once from the server. If done incorrectly, this can result in duplicate events appearing in Facebook. The following steps walk through how to configure this within mParticle.
Using only the mParticle Web SDK (Recommended)
To do this using mParticle, you will need to perform the following steps:
Setup the mParticle Web SDK in your application
Setup two configurations for mParticle’s Facebook integration. One of these configurations must have Use Pixel Server-Side Forwarding enabled and the other must not. Both must have an access token set.
Connect both of these configurations to your Web input. The configuration with server-side Pixel forwarding enabled, must also have Forward Web Requests Serve",16,integrations_facebook_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event,"r Side enabled. Similarly, the connection with Pixel server-side forwarding disabled, must have Forward Web Requests Server Side disabled.
Other Scenarios
Ideally, all Web data sent to mParticle will be sent through the mParticle Web SDK, but it is still possible to deduplicate events outside of this flow if necessary. To ensure redundant events sent through Facebook Pixel and the Facebook Conversions API are correctly deduplicated when they reach Facebook, two conditions must be met:
Events must have consistent event_name values.
Events must have consistent event_id values. For this, the field source_message_id may be used to manually set the Event ID sent to Facebook.
If you use the mParticle Web SDK and server-side web integration, then this will be automatically handled.
If you need to manually assign a source_message_id via the web SDK and server-side separately, use the following API:
mParticle.logBaseEvent({
messageType: 4, // This is the messageType for custom events.
Use 3 for",17,integrations_facebook_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event," page views
name: 'Test Event',
data: {attr1: 'value1'}, // custom attributes
eventType: mParticle.EventType.Navigation, // optional for custom events. Do not set for page views
customFlags: {flag1: 'flagValue1'},
sourceMessageId: 'custom_source_message_id'
});
You can also assign a source_message_id to commerce events:
// 1. Create the product
const product1 = mParticle.eCommerce.createProduct(
'Double Room - Econ Rate',
// Name
'econ-1',
// SKU
100.00,
// Price
4,
// Quantity
);
// 2. Summarize the transaction
const transactionAttributes = {
Id: 'foo-transaction-id',
Revenue: 430.00,
Tax: 30
};
// 3. Log the purchase event
// Optional custom attributes for a product action can be defined as key/value pairs witin an object
const customAttributes = {
'sale': true
};
// Optional custom flags can be defined as key/value pairs within an object
const customFlags = {
'Google.Category': 'travel'
};
const options = {
sourceMessageId: 'custom_source_message_id'
}
mParticle.eCommerce.logProduct",18,integrations_facebook_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event,"Action(
mParticle.ProductActionType.Purchase,
[product1],
customAttributes,
customFlags,
transactionAttributes,
options
);
Note that your workspace will need to be on event batching in order to leverage passing a custom source_message_id to the Web SDK for this to work.
If you are not on web batching, please contact your customer success manager.
Visit the Facebook Business Help Center and Facebook For Developers for more information on the subject of deduplication.
Troubleshooting Facebook Pixel Issues
Please run through the following steps to confirm your settings are correct:
Verify your access token is of type System User and will never expire using this page: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken/
Verify your Pixel ID is valid using this page. Please enter the ID and confirm the Send To Test Events works: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/payload-helper/
If you run into issues with either of the above steps, please repeat the step",19,integrations_facebook_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event,"s described in Configuring Facebook Pixel Server-to-Server.
Event Data Mapping
The iOS/tvOS and Android integrations forward App State Transition, Commerce, Custom, Screen View, and Session Start events.
The Web integration forwards Commerce, Custom, Screen View, and Session Start / End events.

Product Events
You need to turn on sending Purchase Product data through the Facebook Connection Settings modal in the mParticle app to forward product events.
mParticle forwards the mParticle product events Added to Cart and Added to Wishlist to Facebook using Facebook’s corresponding pre-defined event names.
mParticl",26,integrations_facebook_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/event,"e Product Views are forwarded to Facebook as the pre-defined event “Viewed Content”.
The unit price, currency, product category, and SKU are passed to Facebook as well.
See below for a sample Added to Cart event call using the Facebook SDK, and an equivalent call using the mParticle SDK.

Accept the Facebook Audiences Terms of Service
The Facebook Ads account you are connecting to must have accepted the following terms of service:
Custom Audiences Terms of Service
Value Based Custom Audience Terms of Service
Web Custom Audience Terms of Service
To see if you’ve accepted the terms of service:
Log into your Facebook Ad account at adsmanager.facebook.com and click Audiences in the left nav bar.
Make sure that you have the correct ad account selected using the dropdown menu in the top right.
You should be prompted to accept the Facebook Audience terms of service. If you already have accepted these terms of service, you will be presented with the options to create new audiences:
Access to your Facebook Application ID
If you want to forward users’ Facebook IDs with your audience data, you must have the Facebook Application ID number for your app or integration. To find your Facebook Applic",15,integrations_facebook_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,"ation ID, you need to access the Facebook Developer Dashboard. To find your Facebook App ID:

Once you have satisfied the prerequisites described above, follow the steps below to set up the mParticle Facebook audience integration.
Facebook audience integration setup instructions
Setting up and using the audience integration for Facebook includes three stages:
Creating a Facebook audience output in mParticle.
Connecting an audience in mParticle to Facebook.
Finding your new mParticle audiences in Facebook for use in a campaign.
1) Create Facebook audience output
Log into your mParticle account at app.mparticle.com, and navigate to the Integrations Directory.
Search for “Facebook”, hover your cursor over the Facebook tile, and click",16,integrations_facebook_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience," Setup.
Check the box labeled Audience, and click Configure.
Under Account Credentials, click Log In. This opens a separate window where you can connect your Facebook account to mParticle. Click Connect.
Enter a descriptive name under Configuration Name.
Use the Facebook Account ID dropdown menu to select the Facebook account that is tied to the Facebook Ads account you want to forward your audiences to.
Click Save & Open in Connections.
2) Connect an audience to Facebook
If you just completed step 1.7, then you will be brought to Audiences > Real-time in mParticle. Otherwise, from your mParticle account, navigate to Audiences in the left-hand navigation and select either Real-time or Standard.
From the list of audiences, find the one you want to forward to Facebook and click the “plus sign” + button under Connected Outputs.
Click Connect Output.
Select Facebook, and use the Configuration Name dropdown menu to select the new configuration you want to send your audience to. Click Next.
",17,integrations_facebook_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,"Toggle the Connection Status to either Inactive or Active. Only active connections will forward audiences. After completing the setup process, it may take up to 24 hours for your audience data to fully populate in Facebook.
Enter your Facebook Application ID. This is only required if you intend to forward Facebook IDs in the next step.
Check the box next to each of the following user identities you want to forward to Facebook with your audience:
Email address (hashed as SHA256)
Phone number (hashed as SHA256)
Facebook ID
Apple IDFA
Google GAID
Email addresses and Facebook IDs result in higher match rates with Facebook users because they are more unique across the Facebook platform, so it’s recommended to use these identities whenever they are available.
Check Enable Multi-Key Audience to have an additional audience forwarded to Facebook that includes all of the user identities you selected in the previous step.
mParticle creates a new custom audience in your Facebook Ads Manager for ea",18,integrations_facebook_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,"ch identity that you select. For example, if you select both phone and email, you will see two new custom audiences added: one using user phone numbers and one using their email addresses. If you enable Multi-Key Audiences, you will still see a separate audience for each identity, but you will also see an additional audience that includes all of the identities you selected.
Check Match on User Attributes to have mParticle forward all available attributes from the following list for each user. This can increase the match rate for your audience. All user attributes are hashed as SHA256 before being forwarded to Facebook.
Gender
First name
Last name
City
State
Country
To create a value-based lookalike audience, check Is Value Based Audience, and use the User Attribute Representing Value dropdown menu to select an mParticle user attribute to forward to Facebook.
The attribute you select is what Facebook refers to when determining the relative value of a user, and whether or not to include ",19,integrations_facebook_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,"it in the audience. Users with higher values for this attribute are considered more valuable.
To allow attributes with a value of 0 to be forwarded, check Allow Zero Values. Negative values are never forwarded.
Under Customer File Source, select one of the following as the source of your audience data:
Directly from customers: all audience data was collected directly from the audience members
Customers and partners: the audience data was collected both from audience members and from a partner, like a third-party agency
Directly from partners: the audience data was collected only from third-party partners
Starting on July 2, 2018, Facebook requires the disclosure of the origin of audience data. You can read more about this requirement from Facebook.
Select the identity you want to forward to Facebook as an external email address from the External Email Identity Type dropdown.
Including an external email address can help improve your match rate in Facebook.
Select the identity you want t",20,integrations_facebook_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,"o be hashed and forwarded to Facebook for use as an external unique ID from the Multi-Key External ID Type dropdown.
This can be any unique ID, like an advertising ID, loyalty membership ID, user ID, or even a cookie ID, and can help increase your audience’s match rate.
Click Add Connection.
3) Find your new mParticle audience in Facebook
To find your new custom audience(s):
Navigate to your Facebook Ads Manager at adsmanager.facebook.com and log in.
Select the business portfolio containing the ad account that you used when setting up your audience connection using the left-hand navigation.
In the left-hand navigation, click Audiences.
After creating and activating your audience connection between mParticle and Facebook, you will see one or more (depending on your configuration settings) custom audiences added to your Audience list in Facebook Ads Manager.
It can take up to 24 hours for an mParticle audience to completely sync to Facebook.
To edit, share, or create an ad for one of you",21,integrations_facebook_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,"r custom audiences, click the audience name from the list to view the details panel. From the details panel, click the Actions dropdown menu. Certain actions may be unavailable due to missing payment info or a compliance requirement that hasn’t been configured yet for your Ads account.
Deleting an audience
mParticle deletes the downstream audience when you delete an audience from mParticle.
Supported identities
Following are the user identities and device identities that can be forwarded to Facebook. Identities that are hashed as SHA256 are noted.
Facebook ID
Email address (SHA256)
Phone number (SHA256)
Apple IDFA (SHA256)
Google Advertising ID (SHA256)
Android Device ID (SHA256)
Understanding your match rate
The “match rate” for a Facebook audience refers to the percentage of your forwarded user data that Facebook successfully matches to active Facebook users.
When you connect an mParticle audience with Facebook, several user identifiers are included for each audience member (such as ",22,integrations_facebook_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,"email addresses, phone numbers, Facebook user IDs, or mobile advertiser IDs). After you send an audience from mParticle to Facebook, Facebook attempts to match these identifiers to user profiles on Facebook. The match rate indicates how successful Facebook is in finding corresponding user profiles for the identifiers you provided.
There are several factors that can impact your match rate:
Data quality: more accurate, up-to-date, and complete user data leads to a higher match rate.
Privacy settings: Facebook users with stricter privacy or data sharing settings may also impact your match rate.
Identifiers used: certain identifiers, like email addresses and Facebook user IDs, have higher match rates due to their uniqueness.
Audience size: larger audiences have higher match rates because of the increased chance in finding matches within the set of Facebook users. Facebook suggests a minimum audience size of 1,000 people for best results.
A higher match rate means that more of your user dat",23,integrations_facebook_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,"a was successfully matched to Facebook users, allowing you to reach a larger audience with your ads or other marketing efforts. However, it’s important to keep in mind that not all of your user data may match with Facebook users, and the match rate may vary from one audience to another.
Value-based audiences
You can use the mParticle audiences integration to create value-based lookalike audiences. These audiences target users who share similar characteristics and behaviors with your existing high-value customers.
However, unlike traditional lookalike audiences, which are based solely on demographic or interest similarities, value-based lookalike audiences are generated using an attribute that reflects the monetary value or profitability of your customers. For example, if you select a lifetime value attribute, Facebook will create a lookalike audience composed of users that have a higher lifetime value.
By default, mParticle only forwards users in a value-based audience to Facebook if t",24,integrations_facebook_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,"he value of their “value reprepresenting attribute” is greater than 0. You can include values equaling zero by checking Allow Zero Values when creating your value-based audience.
Value-based audiences can only be created during the process of first connecting an mParticle audience with Facebook. Audiences that have already been connected to Facebook can’t be turned into value-based audiences.
You can learn more about value-based lookalike audiences in Facebook’s documentation.
Customer File Source Requirements
As of July 2, 2018, Facebook requires that all new audiences disclose whether their data was collected from customers directly, collected from partners, or both. You can provide this information in the connection settings when connecting an audience to Facebook via the Customer File Source setting.
You can learn more about the Customer File Source Requirement in Facebook’s documentation.
Data forwarding
Limits
Facebook does not allow more than 500 custom audiences to be created p",25,integrations_facebook_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,"er Facebook Ads account. If you attempt to forward more than 500 audiences to Facebook, an error will be returned.
Upload frequency
The Facebook Audience integration uses bulk forwarding. This means that instead of forwarding audience data in real time, mParticle adds updates to a queue. By default, mParticle forwards data to Facebook from this queue whenever one of the following conditions is met:
3 hours have passed since the last update
At least 75,000 messages are in the queue
Verify and troubleshoot your connection
Before activating your new connection, or when troubleshooting issues, please be aware of the following:
Are you forwarding audience data to the correct Facebook Ads account?
During steps 4-5 of the first stage of the setup process, you connect your Facebook account to mParticle. Make sure that you use a Facebook account that has been granted access to the Facebook Ads account you will forward your audiences to, and make sure that after connecting your Facebook account ",26,integrations_facebook_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,"that you use the Facebook Account ID dropdown menu to select the Facebook Ads account.
It is possible to have access to multiple Ads accounts, so make sure that you selected the correct Ads account when creating your output.
Read Access to a Facebook Ads account for instructions on how to make sure your Facebook account has the correct access. If you do not have the correct access, reach out to your Facebook Ads account administrator.
If you are forwarding Facebook IDs, did you add the correct Facebook app ID?
If you are trying to forward Facebook IDs from mParticle to Facebook, you must provide your Facebook application ID.
Often referred to as an app ID, a Facebook Application ID is a unique ID assigned to your application when you register it on the Facebook Developers platform. This App ID is required to integrate your application with various Facebook functions, such as logging in through Facebook, accessing Facebook’s Graph API, or incorporating social plugins like the Like butto",27,integrations_facebook_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,"n.
See Access to your Facebook Application ID for instructions on how to find your application ID.
Data latency
While you may see your forwarded mParticle audiences listed in Facebook Ads right away, it can take up to 24 hours before your audience data begins to fully populate. This time can vary depending on how large your audiences are.
When looking for your audience data in Facebook, select the correct Business Portfolio
After logging into Facebook Ads Manager, make sure that you select the correct Business Portfolio from the left-hand navbar. You should select the Business Portfolio containing the Ads Account you chose to forward your audiences to.
Forwarding multi-key audiences to Facebook creates multiple audiences
When you select more than one user identity to forward to Facebook, a separate audience will be created in Facebook for each identity you select. If you want to have a single audience containing all of the identities you selected, make sure that you check Enable Multi-",28,integrations_facebook_audience.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/facebook/audience,"Key Audiences when connecting your audience to Facebook.
However, even with multi-key audiences enabled, you will still see an additional audience in Facebook for each identity selected.

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/twitter/audience,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/twitter/audience,"nceZendeskEventFeedQuadratic LabsEventZ2A DigitalEventAudienceQualtricsEventAudiencemParticle’s Twitter Tailored Audience integration enables app owners to push audiences created in Audience Manager to Twitter. Once the integration is activated and your audience is pushed to Twitter, you can then target Promoted Tweets to your Tailored Audiences for engagement, cross-promotion, exclusion targeting or monetization use cases.
Prerequisites
In order to enable audience forwarding to Twitter, you will need the account credentials for a Twitter account that is linked to your app’s Twitter Ads account.
The integration activation process in Audience Manager will prompt you to log into your Twitter account, and once authorized, mParticle will automatically retrieve the credentials that it needs to forward audiences to Twitter. The account you login with will need a permission level of Account Administrator to connect an affiliated Ad Account.

It is possible to view audience status in the Ads UI via “Audience Manager” dashboard.
Activate the Integration
Add the Twitter Audience integration to your setup from the Directory.
From Setup > Outputs Add a new Twitter Audience Configuration.
Log into Twitter from the popup, select your advertising account and click Save.
From your audience’s Connect page, add Twitter as an output and select the configuration you created. You can choose whether or not to forward emails, Twitter handles and device IDs to Twitter. Click Add Connection to finalize the connection.
User Identity Mapping
Depending on the Configuration Settings that you select (see below), Twitter will use one or more of the following IDs to match users:
Email address
Twitter handle
Device IDs (IDFA for Apple OS, Google Ad ID for Android)
mParticle sends these IDs as a SHA-256 hash.

Prerequisites
Before you start this activity, you should have already:
Created an input.
Data in mParticle
mParticle collects two important kinds of data:
Event data
Event data is about actions taken by a user in your app. Some events are collected automatically by mParticle’s native SDKs. These include the Session Start events you saw in the Live stream when you first set up your input. Other events need to be captured by writing code in your app",9,guides_getting-started_start-capturing-data__verify-look-for-incoming-data-in-the-live-stream.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/start-capturing-data/#verify-look-for-incoming-data-in-the-live-stream,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/start-capturing-data/#verify-look-for-incoming-data-in-the-live-stream,". Of these, the most significant are:
Screen/Page Views - keep track of where a user is in your app
Custom Events - track any actions the user might take in your app, such as clicking a button or watching a video.
Commerce Events - track purchases and other product-related activity.
User data
mParticle also captures data about your user, including their identities, information about the device they are using and any custom attributes you set. As with event data, some user data, such as information about the devices they use, is captured automatically by mParticle’s native SDKs. Two important types of user data must be captured by writing code in your app:
User identities are unique identifiers for your user, like an email address or customer ID. These are different from the device identities collected automatically by the SDKs, which don’t identify an individual person but a particular cell phone, browser session, or some other device. User identities help mParticle keep track of uniqu",10,guides_getting-started_start-capturing-data__verify-look-for-incoming-data-in-the-live-stream.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/start-capturing-data/#verify-look-for-incoming-data-in-the-live-stream,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/start-capturing-data/#verify-look-for-incoming-data-in-the-live-stream,"e users of your app and allow you to track a user’s activity over time and across different devices. To learn a lot more about user and device identities, read our IDSync guide. For now, you just need to know that a user identity is a way of identifying a person, independently of the device they are currently using.
User Attributes are key-value pairs that can store any custom data about your user. The value of a user attribute can be:
A string
A number
A list
A boolean value (true or false)
null - attributes with a null value function as ‘tags’, and can be used to sort your users into categories.
Capture User and Event Data
To start capturing data you will need to go back to your app code. In the previous step you should have installed and initialized the mParticle SDK in at least one of your app platforms. This means you’re already set up to capture Session Start and Session End events, as well as basic data about the device. Grab a friendly developer again, if you need one, and try ",11,guides_getting-started_start-capturing-data__verify-look-for-incoming-data-in-the-live-stream.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/start-capturing-data/#verify-look-for-incoming-data-in-the-live-stream,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/start-capturing-data/#verify-look-for-incoming-data-in-the-live-stream,"to add some additional user and event data to your implementation. Here are a few things you might try, with links to the appropriate developer docs:
Add a Customer ID or Email Address for a user.Android / iOS / Web
Create a custom user attribute that tells you something about a user. For example: status: ""premium"".Android / iOS / Web
Create a page or screen view event that captures the name of a page or screen being viewed. Android / iOS / Web
Create a custom event to track a user action in your app. Include some custom attributes. For example, the mPTravel app sends a custom event when a user views one of its content videos.

Once you’ve added code to your app to start collecting some basic data, start up a development build of your app again and trigger some events. Have another look at the Live Stream. You should start to see new event batches, with the individual events you have added to your app.
Troubleshoot
If you have at least some data in your Live Stream, such as the session start and session end messages generated in the previous step, but your screen views, custom events or purchases aren’t showing, it’s likely that there is an issue with your app code.
Check that your code is correctly formed, and that the methods which send events to mParticle are actually triggered by user activity in your app.
Review your development environment’s logs. These will show when an event is sent to mParticle.
Next steps
Excellent, you’ve started collecting real custom datapoints from your app. At this point you might want to take a quick break to:

Prerequisites
Before you start this activity, you should have already:
Created an input
Started to collect some basic data points
Get some more data
Up until this point, you’ve been testing your account with a single development build of your app. This works well to establish basic data throughput.
The Audiences feature allows you to target segments of your users based on their activity or attributes. So to effectively use Audiences, even at the testing stage, your app needs multiple users!
If you’re not",9,guides_getting-started_create-an-audience_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-audience/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-audience/," ready to enable the mParticle SDKs in your Production app yet, you can either spin up multiple development environments, or try using the Events API to supply some test data in bulk.
Create your Audience
The mPTravel app lets users watch video content about travel destinations. This tutorial creates an audience to allow mPTravel to target users who view content about a paticular destination with deals for that destination.
Create Criteria
To define an audience, you need to specify some selection criteria. Click Add Criteria.
Choose the type of criteria you want to create. Except for the Users type, which is covered below, these criteria all correspond to mParticle event types. Click Events to target custom events.
There are three distinct aspects of an event criteria that you can define:
Event name - mParticle populates a dropdown list based on all event names received for the workspace. This means that you can only select events that have already been captured by mParticle. This exam",10,guides_getting-started_create-an-audience_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-audience/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-audience/,"ple targets the “Play Video” event name.
Attributes - you can refine your criteria further by setting attribute conditions. This example targets only instances of the Play Video event where the “category” attribute has a value of “Destination Intro” and the “destination” attribute has a value of “Paris”.
Note that this example creates an Exact Match condition, but there are other types of condition to explore. For example, if you set “destination” Contains “France”, then you could match events with a “destination” of both “Paris, France” and “Cannes, France”.
The types of condition available depend on what kind of data an attribute holds. For example, an attribute that records a number value will have Greater Than and Less Than conditions. mParticle automatically detects what type of data an attribute holds. However, you can manually set the data type by clicking the type symbol.
Don’t change the data type unless you really know what you’re doing. If you force the data type to be Numbe",11,guides_getting-started_create-an-audience_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-audience/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-audience/,"r, and all your attribute values are strings, your condition will always fail! As long as you’re sending the same type of data consistently for each attribute, you shouldn’t have to worry about it.
Recency / Frequency - Sets how many times the user needs to trigger a matching event, and in what time period, in order to meet the condition. If you don’t specify anything here, the default for Recency / Frequency is “Greater than 0 events in the last 30 days”.
When you’re happy with your criteria, click Done.
Add Multiple Criteria
You could save this audience right now and target all users who have watched mPTravel’s Paris content in the past three days. But, what if you have some extra special limited deals that you want to save for your premium members? You can’t just tell everyone! You need to add a second criteria. Whenever you have multiple criteria, you need to decide how to evaluate them together. There are three options:
And - both conditions have to be true for a user to be added ",12,guides_getting-started_create-an-audience_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-audience/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-audience/,"to the audience
Or - a user will be added to the audience if either condition is true
Exclude - a user will be added only if the first condition is true, but the second is false. Exclude is great for use cases like abandoned cart targeting. You can select users who triggered an Add to Cart event, then exclude users who triggered a Purchase event.
To target users who watched Paris content, AND are premium members, choose And.
This is a good opportunity to look at the User criteria type, as it’s a little different. Where the other criteria match users who have triggered a particular event, the User criteria looks at all other information you might know about your users: the type of device they use, where they live, their custom user attributes, etc. This example targets users with a user attribute of “status”, with a value of “Premium”.
When you’ve added as many criteria as you need, click Save as Draft to come back to your definition later, or Activate to start calculating.
When you act",13,guides_getting-started_create-an-audience_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-audience/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-audience/,"ivate the audience, you’ll be asked if you want to set up an A/B Test. Select No for now, to go to the Connections Screen.
Verify your Audience
Check that size is greater than zero
After you finish defining your audience you will be taken straight to the Audience Connection screen. Connecting an audience will be covered in the next section.
First, check that your audience definition is working as expected. Start by selecting Audiences from the left column to go to the main Audiences page. Audiences take time to calculate, so if you’ve only just activated it, you’ll probably see a Size of 0 for your audience. Mouseover the pie chart to see how far along the calculation process is.
After a while, as long as you have users that match your criteria, you should start to see the value of the Size column increase.
If the audience is 100% calculated, and your size is still zero, there may be an issue with your conditions.
Download to verify individual memberships
In some cases, it might be eno",14,guides_getting-started_create-an-audience_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-audience/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-audience/,"ugh just to know that your audience is matching users. However, if you know specific identities of users who should match your criteria, you can check that they matched by downloading your entire audience in CSV form. Follow the instructions here to download your audience.
Troubleshoot
For simple audiences, it’s a good idea to check your Live Stream to see if you can find an event that should match your criteria. Here, you can see a user who has triggered the correct event.
Some things to check:
Make sure you selected the right platforms. If the matching events are all from iOS, and you only selected the Android platform when creating the audience, you won’t match any users.
Examine each of your conditions against your test data from the Live Stream. Matches in the Audience Builder are not case sensitive. If you’ve set attribute conditions, do the attribute values in your test data exactly match the value you’ve provided in your condition?
If you have multiple criteria, make sure your ",15,guides_getting-started_create-an-audience_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-audience/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-audience/,"chaining statements are correct. Did you select And when you meant Or?
Remember that recalculating an audience will take some time, so check your criteria thoroughly before you save your changes.
Next steps
Congratulations on making your first audience in mParticle! You will have noticed that mParticle populates your options in the Audience Builder based on the data you have captured. This means that as you add new sources, and send more data, you will unlock new options for building audiences. Check in periodically to make sure that you’re getting the most out of your data. Some mParticle clients create hundreds of audiences, each with dozens of chained criteria to target hyper-specific user segments. You’re only limited by the data you can capture and your imagination.
A few things to read or think about:
The Audience docs in the Platform Guide provide more detail about building criteria and advanced features like A/B Testing, and Audience Sharing.

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/mixpanel/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/mixpanel/event,"nceZendeskEventFeedQuadratic LabsEventZ2A DigitalEventAudienceQualtricsEventEventMixpanel’s mission is to increase the rate of innovation. Companies use Mixpanel to analyze how & why users engage, convert, and retain in real-time on web, mobile, and IoT devices, and then use the data to improve their products.
Overview & Prerequisites
If you are new to setting up Mixpanel’s Mobile App Analytics, your best place to start is Mixpanel itself and the below are must-reads before proceeding:
Mobile App Analytics Setup Overview: https://mixpanel.com/help/reference
Best Practices for setting up your events: https://mixpanel.com/help/reference/ios#sending-events
When mParticle sends data to Mixpanel, Mixpanel’s APIs are utilized.
This allows mParticle to implement server side data forwarding and supports our value proposition to customers of not requiring that additional app SDK components be continually added and updated for integrations.
In order to enable mParticle’s integration with Mixpane",14,integrations_mixpanel_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/mixpanel/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/mixpanel/event,"l, you will need an account with Mixpanel and have your Mixpanel Token for mParticle configuration. Your Mixpanel Token can be found at the Mixpanel topic, Find Project Token.
It is important to ensure that your mParticle data implementation plan captures the correct instrumentation scheme to map to your desired Mixpanel feature sets. In other words, depending upon what Mixpanel feature set you decide to implement, may drive some of how you structure your app with the mParticle SDK.
Data Processing Notes
User and Event attributes with string values of ""true"" or ""false"" (not case sensitive), will be converted to boolean values before being forwarded to Mixpanel.
Supported Features
mParticle’s SDK supports nearly all of the Mixpanel SDK specific features natively. When you use the mParticle SDK, mParticle events will be transformed using Mixpanel-compliant naming conventions and activate the corresponding features automatically.

User Identification
One of the key features of Mixpanel is funnel tracking, this feature requires a consistent approach to identifying your users as they sign up, and progress from being only identifiable by their device, to having a unique “logged in” ID.
mParticle manages this process using its IDSync feature. IDSync gives you granular control over how user profiles are managed. To support IDSync, mParticle maintai",16,integrations_mixpanel_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/mixpanel/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/mixpanel/event,"ns a hierarchy of different ID types.
A traditional Mixpanel implementation, using the Mixpanel SDK, manages sign-up funnels by using the following process:
When a user first downloads your app, the Distinct ID is set using a default anonymous device id (Apple Advertising ID for iOS, a random GUID for Android, a Cookie ID for Web).
When you know the identity of the current user, typically after log-in or sign-up, you call Mixpanel’s identify method. Mixpanel recommends against using identify for anonymous visitors to your site.
If your project has Mixpanel’s ID Merge feature enabled, the call to identify will connect pre- and post-authentication events when appropriate.
If your project does not have ID Merge enabled, identify will change the user’s local distinct_id to the unique ID you pass. Events tracked prior to authentication will not be connected to the same user identity. If ID Merge is disabled,
Alias can be used to tie the original Distinct ID (an anonymous device ID) and the ",17,integrations_mixpanel_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/mixpanel/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/mixpanel/event,"new Distinct ID (a unique User ID) together in Mixpanel.
If this process is not followed correctly, funnel tracking won’t be possible, as Mixpanel will see the two Distinct IDs as two completely separate users.
If you wish to use Mixpanel’s funnel tracking features, here is one option for implementing with mParticle:
Option 1 - Use mParticle ID as the Distinct ID
This option is recommended for new implementations. This option lets your Mixpanel user profiles mirror those maintained by mParticle. This option lets your mParticle Identity strategy take care of aliasing for you, before your data ever reaches Mixpanel.
For this to work, you need to have selected an Identity Strategy that supports funnel tracking, such as the Profile Conversion Strategy. If you use the Profile Conversion Strategy and mParticle’s Customer ID as your logged-in ID type, a sign-up flow works as follows:
When a user first downloads your app, mParticle creates a new user profile, with a new, unique mParticle ID. m",18,integrations_mixpanel_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/mixpanel/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/mixpanel/event,"Particle immediately begins forwarding event data to Mixpanel, mapping the mParticle ID to Mixpanel’s Distinct ID.
When the user creates an account, and you add a Customer ID, mParticle associates the new Customer ID with the original user profile. Now you have a new way of identifying users in the mParticle SDK, the mParticle ID — mapped to Mixpanel as the Distinct ID — which never changes.
To use this option, set the External Identity Type to mParticle ID in the Configuration Settings.
Note that this example is the minimum necessary to demonstrate the required sign-up flow and does not include additional features, such as completion handlers. Refer to the full Identity documentation:

Historical Event Tracking
mParticle sends data to different Mixpanel endpoints depending on the age of the events:
Events that are less than or equal to 5 days old are sent to the track endpoint.
Events that are greater than 5 days old are sent to the import endpoint.
In order for mParticle to send the historical data to Mixpanel, you must provide the API Secret. If not provided, mParticle will drop these events.
Super Property Tracking

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/mixpanel/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/mixpanel/event,"rties allow certain properties that you want to include with each event you send. Generally, these are things you know about the user rather than about a specific event, for example, the user’s age, gender, or source. These super properties will be automatically included with all tracked events. Super properties are saved to device storage, and will persist across invocations of your app.

Only specific data will be considered as part of the transactional funnel. Standard message data format is:
action type: $transaction for a TrackCharge message
token: the application’s Mixpanel token
distinct_id: device’s UDID or user’s customerId
ip: the IP address of the request or “0”
time: the message timestamp
insert_id: used to de-duplicate events - this is set to mParticle event_id.
Data being sent in the transactions section:

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/ios/overview/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/ios/overview/," to integrate the iOS SDK from start to finish
To demonstrate how mParticle works, you will learn how to track basic event data like page views and product purchases in a mobile app using the mParticle iOS SDK. Then, you will learn how to send that data to a webhook. You will also learn how to manage your data quality by creating a data plan.
mParticle provides thirteen SDKs for specific platforms like web, iOS, and Android, in addition to several APIs. mParticle also provides over 250 integrations with data warehouse, analytics, and marketing automation tools.
To keep your first steps with mParticle quick and easy, this tutorial uses the iOS SDK and a sample ecommerce app called The Higgs Shop.
This is a technical tutorial for developers. If you aren’t a developer, you can find a general introduction to mParticle in the Platform Guide.
About the iOS SDK
mParticle’s iOS SDK supports both mobile iOS and tvOS devices.
By initializing the iOS SDK in your app, you gain access to useful met",10,developers_quickstart_ios_overview_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/ios/overview/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/ios/overview/,"hods you can call in your app’s code to send events and user data to mParticle.
Prerequisites
Access to an mParticle instance
In order to begin sending data from your app to mParticle, you need access to an mParticle account and an API key.
Download the mParticle sample app
This tutorial demonstrates how mParticle works using The Higgs Shop, a sample iOS application written in the Swift programming language.
Open your terminal or command prompt, and clone the iOS sample app repository on GitHub.
Open the sample app in Xcode
If you don’t already have Xcode installed on your computer, download and install the correction version for your OS now.
Navigate to your cloned directory of the iOS sample app and open HiggsShopSampleApp.xcodeproj in Xcode.
Any missing dependencies will be automatically updated by the Swift Package Manager in Xcode.
Click the Run icon in the toolbar to ensure that you can successfully build the sample app.

Prerequisites
Before you start this activity, you should have already:
Created an input
Started to capture some basic data points
Outputs
Outputs are mParticle’s term for the services where we forward your data. Outputs are also referred to as “integrations”. Outputs come in two types: “event”, and “audience”. Audiences are covered in the next part of this guide. This section will show you how to set up an eve",9,guides_getting-started_connect-an-event-output.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output,"nt output.
Example - Connect an Output to Analytics
mParticle has over a hundred event outputs, and the connection process for each is similar. This tutorial creates a connection to Analytics as an example. You can follow the same steps with a different output, or create a free Analytics account to follow along exactly.
Find Analytics in the Directory
Click Directory in the sidebar, and search for Analytics.
Click the Analytics tile to display Output: Event Configuration.
Enter the configuration information:
Enter a configuration name.
Leave the box checked to use the same settings for Development & Production.
Select a field as the user identity field. Leave the default if you’re not sure what to choose.
Enter the Analytics API key which you can find in the Analytics project settings.
Remember to save your new output configuration.
Create the Connection
Now that you have both an input and an output set up, it’s time to connect them:
Click Connections > Connect, and select the input yo",10,guides_getting-started_connect-an-event-output.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output,"u’ve already set up.
Click Connect Output.
Select your Analytics configuration.
Complete the Connection Settings, different for each output. For Analytics you can leave the default selections.
Set the status to Active and click Save.
Verify: Check that data is arriving in Analytics
Once you have enabled the connection, open up the development build of your app again and create a few more events. Each output service displays the data it receives differently. For Analytics, you can view real-time data in the Debug Console.
Troubleshoot
If you don’t see data arriving in the output service, navigate to Data Master > Live Stream and select Message Direction Outbound.
If you see messages in the outbound Live Stream, but none in the output service:
You may just need to wait. For most event outputs, mParticle forwards information in close to real time. However, there are factors which can slow down processing and the amount of time it takes for data to become visible in an output service’s das",11,guides_getting-started_connect-an-event-output.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output,"hboard can be different for each service.
Navigate to Activity > System Alerts and see if there are any errors noted for the output you want to troubleshoot. The error type may give you a clue as to what is wrong.
If the previous step doesn’t resolve the issue:
Check all of your Configuration and Connection settings. Make sure that all settings are correct, especially any access credentials, such as Project or App IDs, API Key & Secret, etc.
It is common for a particular output service to require certain identifiers or other data points to be present to allow data to be forwarded. As an example, the Google Ads output requires information about a user’s device, including the Device Advertising ID, in order to construct a User Agent Header. If the Device Advertising ID is not present, no data can be sent. Check the docs for the output service and make sure you’re sending all the required information.
If there are no outgoing messages in the Live Stream, then mParticle is not attempting t",12,guides_getting-started_connect-an-event-output.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output,"o send any data to the output service. Some possible reasons for this include:
Not all outputs support every platform or accept every event type. The Directory shows a list of available platforms and supported event types for each output. Make sure the data you are trying to send is supported.
mParticle allows you to filter your data for each output. Check the Data Filter to make sure you haven’t turned off the data points you’re trying to send.
Next steps
By now you should be successfully forwarding data to at least one event output. Some additional resources you might want to look at include:
One of the key benefits of mParticle is the power to collect data once and forward it to as many output services as you wish. Browse the Integrations section of our docs to learn more about the different services mParticle can forward your data to.
Most event outputs work by forwarding data server-side via the output partner’s HTTP API. However, some outputs require extra client-side code to be ",13,guides_getting-started_connect-an-event-output.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/connect-an-event-output,"added to your native app, to allow data to be sent directly from your app to the output service. These integrations are called “embedded kits”. You can read more about them in the iOS and Android documentation.
Sending web data to an output usually works a little differently from native. If you’re using mParticle on the web, read our guide to Working with Web Data.
Next up, you will learn about the second category of mParticle data by creating an audience.Was this page helpful?YesNoLast Updated: February 27, 2025© 2025 mParticle, Inc.

Now, with the mParticle Flutter Plugin, you can leverage a single API to deploy your data to hundreds of integrations from your iOS, Android, and Web apps.
Installation
Add the Flutter SDK as a dependency to your Flutter application:
flutter pub add mparticle_flutter_sdk
Specifying this dependency adds a line like the following to your package’s pubspec.yaml:
dependencies:
mparticle_flutter_sdk: ^0.0.1

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/flutter/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/flutter/getting-started/,"o your Dart code:
import 'package:mparticle_flutter_sdk/mparticle_flutter_sdk.dart'
Now that you have the mParticle Dart plugin, install mParticle on your native or web platforms.
Be sure to include an API Key and Secret where required or you will see errors in your logs when launching your app.
Web
Add the mParticle snippet to your web/index.html file as high as possible on the page within the

iOS
Copy your mParticle key and secret** from your app’s dashboard.
Install the SDK using CocoaPods:
$ # Update your Podfile to depend on 'mParticle-Apple-SDK' version 8.5.0 or later
$ pod install
You must initialize the SDK with an MParticleOptions object with a minimum of your mParticle workspace key and secret.
Supply your MParticleOptions object to the mParticle start API to initialize the SDK:

The SDK performs very little work before delegating all actions to a background queue. Also, do not use Grand Central Dispatch’s dispatch_async API to start the SDK. If the SDK is initialized later in the UIApplication lifecycle, session and installation events may not be recorded correctly.

Android
Add the following dependencies to your app’s build.gradle:
dependencies {

// Required for gathering Android Advertising ID (see below)
implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier:16.0.0'
// Recommended to query the Google Play install referrer
implementation 'com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer:1.0'
}
Grab your mParticle key and secret from your workspace’s dashboard and construct an MParticleOptions object.

You must initialize the SDK with an MParticleOptions object and its respective builder class. At minimum you must supply your mParticle input key and secret via the credentials() builder API.
We recommend initializing the SDK in the onCreate() method of your app’s Application class. If you prefer, you may initialize the SDK in an Activity class - as long as the SDK is initialized prior to any other SDK API calls.

This feature is not prescriptive and there is no single way to implement consent or opt-out.

Common uses of data privacy controls
Data privacy controls are flexible and customizable, allowing you to build any data flow or consent-based logic you need.
Use mParticle’s data privacy controls to help comply with CCPA’s “do not sell my data” requirement by collecting users who opt-out and blocking those users’ data from flowing to any ‘data sale’ output by:
Recording a CCPA data sale opt-out as a user consent (more information below)
Identify which outputs count as ‘data sale’ and apply the below forwarding rule to them
Applying a forwarding rule of: Do not forward if CCPA Data sale opt out is present
GDPR defines consent as one method of lawful data processing. One common setup is to:
Define a processing purpose of ‘marketing’
Prompt users for affirmative consent for ‘marketing’
Identify which outputs would perform ‘analytics’ processing
Apply a forwarding rule of: Only forward user data if GDPR Consent for ‘marketing’ is true
Data privacy and the mP",10,guides_data-privacy-controls_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls/,"article platform
Once enabled and configured, data privacy work with the mParticle platform to ingest and pass on consent state:
Define categories of data collection called consent purposes.
Store the consent state in a user’s profile.
Control data flow based on stored consent.
Send user consent state to your integrations (outputs).
Enabling data privacy controls
Data privacy controls save user consent decisions and applies them to data flows.
Enable GDPR and/or CCPA compliance features on your workspace from Workspace Settings > Workspace > Regulation.
For GDPR, create a set of purposes from Privacy > Privacy Settings in the dashboard.
Once a purpose has been added it cannot be removed.
A purpose defines the scope of data collection and processing to which the user may consent. GDPR recognizes several different purposes for data collection including the possibility of a user consenting to some purposes of data collection but not others. mParticle does not limit you to a specific set o",11,guides_data-privacy-controls_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls/,"f purposes, but rather lets you define your own purposes when you set up a workspace.
For CCPA, once it is enabled in your workspace, the purpose data_sale_opt_out is automatically created. The SDKs and mParticle UIs facilitate using this purpose, so you don’t need to hardcode it anywhere.
Consent properties
The mParticle format for a single record of a user decision on a privacy prompt, .consent, is our consent_state object. This is used for both GDPR-style opt-in consent and for CCPA-style opt-out.
For each user or workspace, consent state can be stored for each possible combination of regulation and purpose. For each purpose, the following fields are supported.
All fields are optional, except consented, timestamp_unixtime_ms, regulation and purpose. The regulation and purpose fields are built into the structure. Be sure to include your privacy and compliance experts when deciding how to implement optional fields.

For detailed definitions of how to report consent state, review the sections of our API and SDK references that cover data privacy controls:
Web SDK
iOS SDK
Android SDK
AMP SDK
HTTP API
Additionally, our integration with OneTrust allows you to ingest customer consent states into mParticle.
Using consent state
User profiles
Consent state is maintained per person on the User Profile using the structure defined above.
For testing consent, you can use User Activity View to check that a consent was recorded correctly. Here is an example of how CCPA data sale opt-out will appear:
Audien",15,guides_data-privacy-controls_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls/,"ces
Consent state can be used to create conditions in the Audience Builder to check a users’ consent state as a requirement for audience inclusion or exclusion.
For example, for CCPA you may want to include only users who have NOT opted out of data sale, by adding a criteria like this:
For GDPR, you may want to include only users that have an opt-in consent for a given purpose, shown here as ‘Advertising’:
Connections and forwarding rules
Consent state can be used to create forwarding rules that selectively filter data based on a users consent state, in real time and per-person.
For example, you can choose to only forward data from users who have given consent for a particular purpose.
For CCPA, you may want a forwarding rule to apply a data sale opt-out. In this example, users’ who have a consent state of true for the CCPA purpose of data_sale_opt_out will NOT have their data forwarded (if the consent state is missing or false for that purpose, data will flow):
For GDPR, you may want ",16,guides_data-privacy-controls_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls/,"a forwarding rule to only send data when a single purpose is consented:
Kits and forwarding rules
If you set up a Forwarding Rule for an embedded kit integration, the iOS and Android SDKs will check consent status for the user on initialization. If the rule condition fails, the kit will not be initialized. Note that kits are only initialized when a session begins or on user change, so if consent status changes in the course of a session, while mParticle will immediately stop forwarding data to the kit, it is possible that an embedded kit may remain active and independently forwarding data to a partner from the client until the session ends.
Forwarding consent state to partners
When the consent state of a profile changes, that change can be communicated to mParticle event integrations. If the consent_state object on an incoming event batch contains changes from the existing profile, mParticle adds a ‘system notification’ to the batch for each consent state change before the batch is sen",17,guides_data-privacy-controls_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls/,"t to incoming forwarders. This notification contains the full old and new consent state objects:

Some partners accept raw event batch data from mParticle, mostly for data storage or custom analytics use cases. For these partners, mParticle will forward the ‘system_notifications’ object with each relevant event batch. For",18,guides_data-privacy-controls_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-privacy-controls/,"warding of system notifications can be turned off with a user setting. Integrations that can currently receive the system notifications object include:
Amazon Kinesis
Amazon S3
Amazon SNS
Amazon SQS
Google Pub/Sub
Google Cloud Storage
Microsoft Azure Event Hubs
Slack
Webhook
mParticle is working with other partners to support forwarding consent state changes as a Custom Event. These events contain the new consent state information as custom attributes, a custom event type of ""Consent"", and an event name of ""Consent Given"" or ""Consent Rejected"". These consent events are forwarded to supporting partners as standard custom events.

“GDPR Consent Change” is
listed as a data type in the Integrations directory and we will update this list as more partners add support. Please reach out to your success manager if you would like to distribute consent to an additional partner.
Data subject requests
mParticle helps you respond to data subject requests as mandated by the GDPR and CCPA regulations.
You can search for integrations that support data subject requests in the Integrations page. Search on category Data Subject Request.
Ingest GPC signals
The California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) and the upcoming CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act) require that users can signal their privacy choices. In support of that requirement, you can ingest Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals with mParticle.
Browsers append the GPC signal to HTTP requests and make it queryab",20,guides_data-privacy-controls_.txt

This signal is designed to convey a person’s request to websites and services to not sell or share their personal information with third parties, per the Global Privacy Control specification. This opt-out is at the browser level, allowing users to turn on the GPC signal for all or specific websites.
The workflow for ingesting and forwarding GPC signals via SDK or Events API:

You define a calculated attribute in mParticle and, once activated, they are computed automatically over time by using the raw data stream of events and user information. Once you’ve created calculated attributes, you can use them as segmentation criteria in Audiences, Profile API, ",9,guides_personalization_calculated-attributes_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,"or connect them downstream to any of your tools. This is incredibly powerful, and can be set up with a few button clicks–no SQL, no pipeline management.
Calculated attributes are a paid premium feature. Contact your mParticle representative if you’re interested in using calculated attributes.
You can define calculated attributes to track almost anything on an individual user, from counting the number of logins in the last 30 days or knowing the last product category viewed, to more complex calculations like the customer’s average order revenue or the most frequent purchase.
Calculated attributes provide value in many ways:
Enabling and targeting personalized campaigns with an always-on understanding of the customer’s behavior
Helping marketers, product managers and data scientists better understand customer behavior and interactions with their brand
Standardizing calculated values across the entire marketing and analytics stack, across platforms and tools
The following video explains h",10,guides_personalization_calculated-attributes_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,"ow calculated attributes help you quickly generate customer insights without needing any developer resources:
Calculated attributes basics
A calculated attribute contains the following elements that you define:
Name: a descriptive label for the calculated attribute. Once activated, the name can’t be changed.
Description: an optional text field to describe the attribute.
Calculation definition: The logic for computing the attribute: the calculation type, criteria, and the date range. For example, you might specify a sum calculation type.
Status: Calculated attributes are created as drafts, indicating that they are not being calculated. When you change a calculated attribute status to active, mParticle starts calculating the attributes and you can use them across the mParticle platform and downstream.
Scope
Calculated attributes are defined and calculated per workspace; calculations use data available within the same workspace where they are defined. You can create calculated attributes ",11,guides_personalization_calculated-attributes_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,"with the same name and functionality in multiple workspaces.
Initialization
After you activate a calculated attribute, it initializes using existing data in the mParticle CDP along with any seeded value that was sent using Seeding API. Depending on the date range selected in the calculated attribute definition, this can take several hours. After initialization, calculated attributes continue to recalculate with new data.
Calculation speed
Calculations are either synchronous (sent with the batch of data being processed) or asynchronous (sent with the next batch):
Synchronous calculations are evaluated immediately and updated values are included in the same outgoing event batch.
Asynchronous calculations are evaluated with a small delay (usually a few minutes) and updated values are included in the next outgoing event batch or when the feed input named Calculated Attributes is connected (more about this feed). If your event output doesn’t support the Calculated Attributes feed, user attr",12,guides_personalization_calculated-attributes_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,"ibute values may grow stale until mParticle receives the next event or batch for the relevant user.
Calculation categories
We currently support 13 calculations organized into four categories:
Count: calculate the number of times an event has occurred, such as the number of logins or cart views.
Aggregation: calculate a standard statistic about an event attribute such as sum, minimum, or maximum.
Occurrence: calculate the timestamp for an event, or the first or last value or timestamp.
List: calculate the unique list of values for an event attribute. For example, all the unique game titles played or unique product categories viewed.
For a list of calculations and details about each, see Calculated Attributes Reference.
For an overview of how to use calculation categories, view the following video:
Calculation date range
Calculated attributes can apply to a date range that you choose:
Within the Last: limit calculations to a rolling window of time (days or weeks). For example, “most freq",13,guides_personalization_calculated-attributes_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,"uent product categories viewed over the last 30 days.” This will maintain calculations over that specified period of time.
Since: limit calculations to the period of a specified start date to now.
Note that above the date range selection drop-downs, the UI displays the date that data was first ingested into mParticle.
You can choose a date earlier than the first date that data was ingested, however, mParticle only calculates as of the earliest ingestion date.
All time: calculate based on all the data available per your long-term data retention policy. This option is only available if you have the Unlimited Lookback feature.
Unlimited Lookback, which can extend the date range to your long-term data retention, is available as a premium feature.
Conditional logic
After selecting an event, you can add conditions to the attribute in order to more precisely define results. For example, a retailer creating a calculated attribute might use the Contains operator with a Count attribute to count ",14,guides_personalization_calculated-attributes_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,"only the purchases that contain “Sock” in the product name. For a complete list of operators for the four categories of attributes (Count, Aggregation, Occurrence, and List), see Conditions.
Calculation attribute seeding
Seeding allows you to pass in historic values for calculated attributes that mParticle builds on as new data arrives, without passing in the raw events. Seeding allows you to transition from your own calculations to mParticle calculation. For example, you may have data from outside mParticle about the last four months’ bookings. You can create a calculated attribute, then send the seed data to mParticle using the Calculated Attributes Seeding API. mParticle then combines your seed data and live data so there’s no interruption.
You can seed calculated attributes in both draft (recommended) and active states; the calculated attribute must exist before you can seed it.
Seeding requires two pieces of information:
The seed values: the values required to calculate the attrib",15,guides_personalization_calculated-attributes_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,"ute.
The seed cut-off date: any data prior to this date is processed by your team into seed values, and mParticle only uses live data on or after this date in the calculation, combining the result with seed values. Using the correct cut-off date ensures an accurate transition into mParticle and avoids duplications of data in calculating a calculated attribute.
Note the following calculated attribute behavior:
After a calculated attribute is already in an active status, receiving data via historical API doesn’t automatically trigger a recalculation. You must either create a new or update the definition of the calculated attribute to trigger a recalculation.
Seeding of a rolling time window is not supported. Thus, seeded values don’t decrement when they pass out of the calculated attribute window, for example a calculated attribute date range of “within the last 4 weeks.”
Forwarding calculated attributes in an audience integration
If a partner supports user attribute forwarding, you can ",16,guides_personalization_calculated-attributes_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/calculated-attributes/,"forward calculated attributes in an audience integration alongside user attributes. Different partners have implemented user attribute forwarding in different ways.
For example, Salesforce uses a separate data extension while Google BigQuery uses the configuration setting Send User Attributes.

Google Play Services Ads
The Google Play Services Ads framework is necessary to collect the Android Advertising ID (also known as Google Advertising ID). AAID collection is required by all attribution and audience integrations, and many other integrations. Include the com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier artifact, a subset of Google Play Services. The SDK will use reflection to determine if the necessary API is present at runtime.
When apps target Android 13 or above, you need to declare a Google Play services permission in the manifest file as follows:
<uses-permission android:name=""com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID""/>
If your app does not declare this permission when targeting Android 13 or higher, the advert",10,developers_client-sdks_android_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/,"ising ID is automatically removed and replaced with a string of zeroes.
For more information, please check out this link: https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248?hl=en
Google Play Install Referrer
The Google Play “install referrer” string contains information for how the user arrived at your listing in Google Play prior to downloading your app. Collection of this information is recommended in order for attribution, deep linking, and analytics integrations to work properly. There are two ways to collect the install referrer string via mParticle:
(recommended) Add the com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer dependency to your application and the SDK will automatically gather it. This is the latest and most foolproof method
Collect the install referrer string and pass it to mParticle yourself, see the complete API reference for more information
If you're using any ""kits,"" mParticle takes care of forwarding the install referrer string to them regardless o",11,developers_client-sdks_android_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/,"f the method you choose above.
Play Install Referrer Library
Add the com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer library dependency to your app as in the example above and the Android SDK will automatically gather the install referrer string. This is the best way to collect the install referrer due to higher reliability than the intent broadcast. You can read more about the install referrer library here.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
If you’re integration push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging or the legacy Google Cloud Messaging, please see the Android push notification guide. If this is your first time instrumenting the mParticle SDK, we recommend continuing on and coming back to push notification instrumentation after completing the basic SDK integration below.
Initialize the SDK
You can configure the SDK with an MParticleOptions object and its respective builder class. At minimum you must supply your mParticle input key and secret via the credentials() builder API.
We recommend",12,developers_client-sdks_android_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/," initializing the SDK in the onCreate() method of your app’s Application class. If you prefer, you may initialize the SDK in an Activity class - as long as the SDK is initialized prior to any other SDK API calls.
JavaKotlin
//import mParticle
import com.mparticle.MParticle;
import com.mparticle.MParticleOptions;
public class ExampleApplication extends Application {
@Override
public void onCreate() {
super.onCreate();
MParticleOptions options = MParticleOptions.builder(this)
.credentials(""REPLACE ME WITH KEY"", ""REPLACE ME WITH SECRET"")
.build();
MParticle.start(options);
}
}
//import mParticle
import com.mparticle.MParticle
import com.mparticle.MParticleOptions
class ExampleApplication : Application() {
override fun onCreate() {
super.onCreate()
val options = MParticleOptions.builder(this)
.credentials(""REPLACE ME WITH KEY"", ""REPLACE ME WITH SECRET"")
.build()
MParticle.start(options)
}
}
Your Application.onCreate() should only initialize the SDK. The Android operating system will initia",13,developers_client-sdks_android_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/,"lize your Application class any time your app's BroadcastReceivers or Services are invoked. For this reason, it's not advised to log events, set user attributes, or invoke other APIs here - doing so will result in inflated active-user metrics.
Kit Integrations
Several integrations require additional client-side add-on libraries called “kits.” Some kits embed other SDKs, others just contain a bit of additional functionality. Kits are designed to feel just like server-side integrations; you enable, disable, filter, sample, and otherwise tweak kits completely from the mParticle platform UI. Reference the kit documentation for information on kits.
Initial identification request
The SDK will automatically initialize with the most recent user identities from the most recently active user. You may override this by including an identity request via the identify API of your MParticleOptions object:
JavaKotlin
MParticleOptions.Builder options = MParticleOptions.builder(this);
options.identify(id",14,developers_client-sdks_android_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/android/,"entityRequest);
var options = MParticleOptions.builder(this)
options.identify(identityRequest)
See the IDSync documentation for more information on building a complete identity request.Was this page helpful?YesNoLast Updated: February 27, 2025© 2025 mParticle, Inc.

Prerequisites
To activate mParticle’s integration with Amplitude, you need the Amplitude API Key for each app that you’d like to set up.
Your API key is listed on the Amplitude Project Settings page.
The Amplitude integration requires the mParticle Amplitude Kit when connected to a web input. If you are initializing the web SDK using the Snippet Option then the Kit is automatically included for you. If you are Self Hosting the SDK then you need to add this kit manually into your source code.
Data Processing Notes
mParticle will forward User Identities and Attributes to Amplitude, even if there are no events in the batch.
Device/User ID Mapping
Every event in Amplitude has a main Device ID field. mParticle po",14,integrations_amplitude_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/amplitude/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/amplitude/event,"pulates this field as follows:
For Android, the Android ID (falling back to the Android Advertising ID if unavailable)
For iOS, the IDFA (falling back to the IDFV if unavailable)
For Roku, the Roku Advertising ID (falling back to the Roku Publisher ID if not available)
For FireTV, the Fire Advertising ID.
Amplitude also has dedicated fields for particular Device IDs, such as IDFA and Android ID. These will be populated if the ID is available. See
Field Mappings, for more information.
Amplitude requires either a Device ID or a User ID. User ID can be mapped as Email, Customer ID or mParticle ID. If no accepted identifiers are present, data will not be forwarded.
Forwarding Web Data
By default, mParticle forwards web data to Amplitude client-side, by directly invoking Amplitude’s Javascript methods. Optionally, you can choose to forward web data server-to-server in the Connection Settings. Note that if you choose this option, your incoming data must have your selected User ID to be forwa",15,integrations_amplitude_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/amplitude/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/amplitude/event,"rded.
Data Localization
By default, mParticle sends data to the Amplitude organization’s US endpoint for the HTTP API, but Amplitude offers a different endpoint for EU organizations. In mParticle, the Amplitude Organization Configuration Setting allows you to select a target Amplitude organization location.
Event Data Mapping
Screen Views
mParticle will forward all screen views to Amplitude with the Amplitude Event Type set to “Viewed ScreenName”, where ScreenName is the screen name passed to the logScreen SDK method (or the name of the screen’s Activity class if you’re using automatic screen tracking on Android).
Session Forwarding
mParticle will forward all session start and session end events to Amplitude with the Amplitude Event Type set to session_start and session_end.
eCommerce Event Forwarding
Each valid eCommerce event sent to mParticle is expanded into multiple events before being translated and forwarded to Amplitude. While this expansion applies to all eCommerce transaction",16,integrations_amplitude_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/amplitude/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/amplitude/event,"s, the resulting events are dependent on the type of eCommerce event being forwarded and the number of products in the event.
Note: mParticle will not attempt to forward eCommerce Events to Amplitude which contain no Products.
The eCommerce events resulting from the expansion that may be forwarded to Amplitude are:
Transaction level events (e.g. eCommerce - Purchase)
Item level events (e.g. eCommerce - Purchase - Item)
Revenue events (e.g. [Amplitude] Revenue)
Transaction Event
One Transaction Event is forwarded to Amplitude for every valid eCommerce event provided.
Contains a summary of the transaction, including a JSON array of the products sent in the initial eCommerce event.
Item Events
One Item Event is forwarded to Amplitude for every product inside the provided eCommerce event.
Each Item event contains information about one of the products in the provided eCommerce event.
Revenue Event
One Revenue Event is forwarded to Amplitude for every valid Purchase or Refund eCommerce event",17,integrations_amplitude_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/amplitude/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/amplitude/event," provided. Otherwise none is sent.
The name of the Revenue Event is set by Amplitude, and contains revenue information about the Purchase or Refund event.
eCommerce Event Naming
Each valid eCommerce event sent to mParticle will result in a transaction level event being sent to Amplitude. This event contains a summary of the transaction, including a JSON array of the products sent in the initial eCommerce event.
The name given to the Transaction and Item Level Events is determined from the Product Action provided on the eCommerce Event sent to mParticle.

Custom Event Forwarding
Custom events logged via mParticle’s logEvent SDK method and their attributes will be forwarded to Amplitude, with the event name passed to logEvent as the Amplitude Event Type. An event name must be specified or an error will be returned.
Attribution Custom Event Forwarding
Attribution Custom events will be forwarded to Amplitude prefixed with the attribution provider in the event name.
For example, [AppsFlyer] attribution.
Event Attributes that are included with the event are forwarded to Amplitude in user_properties, also prefixed with the attribution provider.
Push Registrati",19,integrations_amplitude_event.txt

Server to Server Web Requests
Only for web requests, mParticle will extract OS and browser info from HTTP user agent.
Similar to Amplitude’s SDK behavior, os_name and os_version will be populated with browser info. For that reason, mParticle will send ",22,integrations_amplitude_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/amplitude/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/amplitude/event,"2 additional Custom User Properties, web_os_name and web_os_version, that will contain OS info. See Amplitude’s doc.
mParticle will also populate device_brand and device_model from the HTTP user agent if the Extract Device Family from User Agent setting is enabled. With this setting enabled, if mParticle cannot determine the device brand or model, it will populate device_brand with the same value as is set for web_os_name. Note, the device values may differ slightly between S2S events and events sent through the Amplitude web kit.

A rule is a script which accepts an incoming mParticle Events API “batch” object and modifies it according to your business logic. Some example use-cases for a rule are:
Modify a batch’s data
Drop a batch
Modify an event’s data
Drop an event from a batch
Add events to a batch
Rule execution
Each of your Inputs, such as for your web, mobile, or server-to-server data, has an individually configured data pipeline, and each Input’s pipeline ",9,guides_platform-guide_rules.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,"contains the same key stages. Rules are therefore applied for a specific Input’s pipeline, and it’s up to you choose where in that Input’s pipeline each Rule is executed. A single Input pipeline may contain multiple Rules each stage.
mParticle pipeline stages
Stage 1 - Input
Data is received by mParticle for a specific Input (such as Web, iOS, or a custom server feed).
Stage 2 - Storage and Processing
The Input’s data is stored and processed by mParticle, including:
mParticle’s profile system, which stores user data and enriches the Input’s data based on the existing profile of that user.
mParticle Data Master tool
Stage 3 - Output
The Input’s data is sent individually to the mParticle Audience system and 300+ partner integrations. In this stage the pipeline actually branches out with a single Input potentially being connected to many Outputs.
Rule application
Rules are applied to a specific Input’s pipeline. There are two places in the pipeline where rules can be applied:
In between S",10,guides_platform-guide_rules.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,"tage 1 and Stage 2
Rules executed between Stage 1 and Stage 2 affect the data sent to both Stage 2 and then Stage 3, including the mParticle profile store, audience store, and all outputs. These are labeled “All Output” Rules in your mParticle dashboard.
Warning: If you specify a subtractive rule as All Outputs and apply it between stages 1 and 2, such as dropping events from a batch, you may remove data that you don't intend to remove and the data may not be recoverable because it's dropped before storage and processing.
In between Stage 2 and Stage 3
You can also apply a rule right before it’s sent to a specific Output. This lets you mutate data to handle specific requirements or mappings that need to occur for a given partner integration.
Rule requirements
All rules accept an mParticle Events API batch object and can return a modified or null batch object.
There are some differences in error handling and available fields depending on pipeline location. See Rules Developer Guide for ",11,guides_platform-guide_rules.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,"details.
A 200ms timeout applies to all rules. You can choose if a batch should be dropped or continue unprocessed by the rules in the case of a timeout.
Rules are executed on the server and only act on data forwarded downstream server-to-server. A warning is shown in the dashboard if you set up one of the following rules:
A rule for integrations that forwards data client-side via a kit.
A rule for hybrid integrations that support forwarding via client-side and server-to-server.
If you are using a rule to modify user identities or user attributes, you must include a “User Identity Change Event” (user_identity_change) or a “User Attribute Change Event” (user_attribute_change). See Rules Developer Guide for an example of user_attribute_change in a rule.
Create a function in AWS
mParticle rules are hosted in your AWS account as Lambda functions. To do this, you need to be able to provide an Amazon Resource Number (ARN) for your rule. See the AWS Lambda documentation for help creating a fu",12,guides_platform-guide_rules.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,"nction.
The Lambda functions used for rules must be hosted in the same AWS region as your mParticle account.
The name of the function must begin with “mpr”
Your development rule must have an alias of “$LATEST”
Your production rule must have an alias of “PROD”
Your ARNs should look something like this:
arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:999999999999:function:mprmylambdafunction:PROD
arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:999999999999:function:mprmylambdafunction:$LATEST
When providing an Amazon Resource Number (ARN), you must specify the correct ARN for the localized data center, or pod, for your mParticle organization. Refer to Data Hosting Locations to determine the correct ARN for your pod. If do not know which pod to specify for your organization, contact your account representative.
IAM user
To connect to your AWS Lambda function, you must provide the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for an IAM user.
In the IAM dashboard, add the following permissions policy for the user:
{
""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",",13,guides_platform-guide_rules.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,"

],
""Resource"": [
""arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:*:function:mpr*""
]
}
]
}
IAM role
You will also need to create a role in IAM. Assign this role the same policy document created above.
Assign this role to each Lambda function you plan to deploy as an mParticle rule.
Creating a rule in the dashboard
Create a rule by navigating to Data Master > Rules
Click New Rule.
Enter your Development and Production ARNs and click Test.
Error handling
When you first test a rule, you must select a Failure Acti",14,guides_platform-guide_rules.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,"on. This determines what happens if your rule throws an unhandled exception. There is no default action, you must select one of the following:
If you choose Discard, an unhandled exception causes your rule return null, effectively dropping the batch.
If you choose Proceed, an unhandled exception causes your rule to return the unaltered batch object, proceeding as if the rule had not been applied.
Regardless of which option you choose, it’s best practice to handle all exceptions in your code, rather than falling back on the above defaults. This is especially true if your rule deals with events, where an unhandled exception from just one event could lead to all events in the batch being dropped.
Javascript syntax
Rule examples and samples use Javascript syntax, but it is possible to use any language supported by AWS Lambda.
exports.handler=(batch,context,callback)=>{
//do something with batch
callback(null, batch)
}
Your code must be a valid Lambda function.
batch is the complete incomin",15,guides_platform-guide_rules.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,"g batch object.
context is a required argument for Lambda functions, but is effectively null for mParticle rules.
Testing rules
The first time you test a rule, you are asked to provide a name, description and failure action. After naming a rule, you can test it by using one of the sample templates provided in the Test rule dialog. You can also copy and paste batch JSON from your Live Stream. If you do this, be sure to pick a full batch to copy, not a single event.
Click Test to run. Optionally, check a box to save your JSON template in local storage for future testing.
You must enter valid batch JSON in the code editor.
If there are any syntactical errors in your code, warning or error icons will display next to the line number with details of the problem so you can correct.
After clicking Test, you can examine the JSON output from your function to see that the input has been modified as expected.
After a successful test you can click Save to save the Rule. Due to recent updates in AWS",16,guides_platform-guide_rules.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules," Lambda, it may be necessary to wait one minute after a successful test in order to save the Rule.
If your test fails, try examining the logs for any console output.
Versioning
When you first create a rule, by default it will only be applied to DEV data. As well as testing a rule with sample JSON you should test the rule in your dev environment to make sure data reaching your output services is as expected. When you are ready to apply a rule to your production data, click Promote to Prod on the rule page. This will create a “v1” production rule.
Note that before a rule can be promoted to Prod, you must remove all console.log() statements.
If you need to make changes, choose $LATEST from the Version dropdown. All other versions are read only. Test your changes with your dev environment and, when you are ready, click Promote to Prod to create “v2” of your production rule.
Note that you can have a maximum of 50 versions per rule. If you have too many versions, select a version and click t",17,guides_platform-guide_rules.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,"he trash can icon to the right of the version number to delete it.
Status
Each rule has a master switch in the Settings panel. If there is a problem with your rule, you can switch it off and it will be disabled for all connections until you enable it again. To disable, click Edit in the right sidebar and set the Status slider to inactive.
Metrics
The following metrics are available:
Invocations - how many times the rule was invoked
Throttles - how many times a 429 throttling response was returned when calling the rule
Errors - how many errors have occurred when calling the rule
These metrics are for the last 24 hours and apply to all connections. Summaries for each rule can be seen on the main rules page. Detailed graph of the previous 24 hours is available on the Monitoring tab of the individual rule page.
Logs
To help you with troubleshooting rules, mParticle maintains logs for each rule where you can view all console output. From an individual rule page, select the Logs tab. You can",18,guides_platform-guide_rules.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/rules," filter messages by date range or search for keywords.
Deleting rules
From the rules listing, select the Delete action to delete the rule. If the rule is applied to any connections, it will be removed from those connections.Was this page helpful?YesNoLast Updated: February 27, 2025© 2025 mParticle, Inc.

There are critical changes coming to mParticle and the Apple SDK for iOS 14.5 and the App Tracking Transparency framework. For more information, navigate to the dedicated guide for iOS 14 and App Tracking Transparency.
Add SDK Dependencies
mParticle’s iOS SDK is powered by a “core” library, which supports mParticle’s server-side integrations and audience platform. Please follow the releases page on Github to stay up to date with the latest versio",9,developers_client-sdks_ios_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/ios/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/ios/,"n.
You can add the SDK via CocoaPods, Carthage, or by building manually from source.
CocoaPods
To integrate the SDK using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:
target '<Your Target>' do
pod 'mParticle-Apple-SDK', '~> 8'
end
Carthage
To integrate the SDK using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:
github ""mparticle/mparticle-apple-sdk"" ~> 8.0
Manual
You can also manually include the latest binary distribution or build the SDK from source.
See the Github releases page for the latest Carthage binaries, which you can manually drag/drop into in your Xcode project.
See the Github wiki for how to manually build the SDK from source.
Initialize the SDK
You can initialize the SDK with an MParticleOptions object. At minimum you must supply your mParticle workspace key and secret.
Supply your MParticleOptions object to the mParticle start API to initialize the SDK:
The SDK is designed to be initialized within the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method. The SDK performs very little wor",10,developers_client-sdks_ios_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/ios/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/ios/,"k before delegating all actions to a background queue. Also, please do not use Grand Central Dispatch’s dispatch_async API to start the SDK. If the SDK is initialized later in the UIApplication lifecycle, session and installation events may not be recorded correctly.
Objective-CSwift
// Assumes the SDK has been included as a dynamic library
// Requires ""Enable Modules (C and Objective-C)"" in pbxproj
@import mParticle_Apple_SDK;
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
//initialize mParticle
MParticleOptions *options = [MParticleOptions optionsWithKey:@""REPLACE WITH APP KEY""
secret:@""REPLACE WITH APP SECRET""];
[[MParticle sharedInstance] startWithOptions:options];
return YES;
}
import mParticle_Apple_SDK
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
//initialize mParticle
let options = MParticleOptions(key: ""REPLACE WITH APP",11,developers_client-sdks_ios_.txt

secret: ""REPLACE WITH APP SECRET"")
MParticle.sharedInstance().start(with: options)
return true
}
Initial identification request
The SDK will automatically initialize with the most recent user identities from the most recently active user. You may override this by including an identity request via the identify API of your MParticleOptions object:
Objective-CSwift
MParticleOptions *options = [MParticleOptions optionsWithKey:@""REPLACE WITH APP KEY""
secret:@""REPLACE WITH APP SECRET""];
options.identifyRequest = identityRequest;
[[MParticle sharedInstance] startWithOptions:options];
let options = MParticleOptions(key: ""REPLACE WITH APP KEY"",
secret: ""REPLACE WITH APP SECRET"")
options.identifyRequest = identityRequest
MParticle.sharedInstance().start(with: options)
See the IDSync documentation for more information on building a complete identity request.
Kit Integrations
Several integrations require additional client-side add-on libraries called “kits.” Some kits embed other SDKs, othe",12,developers_client-sdks_ios_.txt

Introduction
Feeds are a type of integration that allow a third party service to forward event data to an mParticle workspace. Feeds can supplement data collected directly from your app platforms—via mParticle’s SDKs or Events API—with additional data available only from an external source.
Data available from feeds may include:
Attribution data
Location and geo-fencing data
Actions taken by users in response to email and push campaigns
Customer interactions outside your app, such as customer support
Data about your ",9,guides_feeds_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/feeds/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/feeds/,"app users purchased from a third-party
Forwarding data from feeds
When planning a feed implementation, it is important to consider if and how you want the data to be forwarded to any event outputs. Event integrations connect an ‘input’, which is a single platform or feed, to a single ‘output’.
Most outputs can only accept connections from a limited set of platforms. When setting up connections from a feed, you need to know that some feeds can “act-as” iOS, Android, Web, or other platforms.
“Act-as” feeds
Act-as feeds are feeds which mParticle can treat as if they belonged to a single platform. For example, if a feed can “act as” iOS, you can connect the feed to any output that accepts data from the iOS platform.
When you configure an act-as feed, you will need to select the platform you want the feed to act as:
You can connect an act-as feed to any output that can support the platform it is configured to act as.
Note that for act-as feeds, if you wish to capture data for multiple platf",10,guides_feeds_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/feeds/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/feeds/,"orms, you will need to configure multiple instances of the feed — one for each platform.
“Unbound” feeds
If you do not see an option to select an “act-as” platform when you configure a feed, the data from that feed is treated as “unbound”: not tied to a particular platform. For example, a feed that forwards data about user actions in response to an email campaign will be an unbound feed. These events don’t specifically belong to a platform, like iOS or Android, and won’t have the necessary identifiers to be processed as iOS or Android events.
Outputs that only support iOS / Android / Web will not accept data from unbound feeds. However:
Unbound feeds can still be forwarded to Data Warehouse outputs and webhook outputs, like Amazon S3.
Events from unbound feeds can be used to power audience selection criteria.
Some unbound feeds primarily forward user attributes. User attributes updated by a feed can still be forwarded to event output partners through the enrichment process.

The mParticle React Native library helps you leverage a single API to deploy your data to hundreds of integrations from your iOS and Android apps.
Android and iOS support methods for custom events, page views, identity, commerce events, and consent.
Installation
First, download the library from npm:
$ npm install react-native-mparticle --save
For clients using the react-native-tvos library you must add the force flag to the i",9,developers_client-sdks_react-native_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/react-native/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/react-native/getting-started/,"nstall code as shown below. This tells the installer to ignore using the core React Native repository and instead use the tvOS-specific library instead.
$ npm install react-native-mparticle --save --force
Next, copy your mParticle key and secret from your app’s dashboard and then follow the OS-specific instructions below.
iOS
The NPM install step above will automatically include our React framework and the core iOS framework in your project. However depending on your app and its other dependencies you must integrate it in 1 of 2 ways:
Static Libraries are the React Native default, but because the mParticle iOS SDK contains Swift code you need to add an exception for it in the from of a pre-install command in the Podfile.
pre_install do |installer|
installer.pod_targets.each do |pod|
if pod.name == 'mParticle-Apple-SDK'
def pod.build_type;
Pod::BuildType.new(:linkage => :dynamic, :packaging => :framework)
end
end
end
end
Then run the following command
bundle exec pod install
Frameworks ",10,developers_client-sdks_react-native_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/react-native/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/react-native/getting-started/,"are the default for Swift development and while it isn’t preferred by React Native it is supported. Additionally you can define whether the frameworks are built statically or dynamically.
Update your Podfile to be ready to use dynamically linked frameworks by commenting out the following line
# :flipper_configuration => flipper_config,
Then run either of the following commands
$ USE_FRAMEWORKS=static bundle exec pod install
or
$ USE_FRAMEWORKS=dynamic bundle exec pod install
Initialize the mParticle SDK by calling the startWithOptions method within the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: delegate call. Preferably the location of the initialization method call should be one of the last statements in the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:. The startWithOptions method requires an options argument containing your key and secret and an initial Identity request.
The SDK must be initialized in the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method. Other parts of the SDK rely on",11,developers_client-sdks_react-native_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/react-native/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/react-native/getting-started/," the UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification notification to function properly. Failing to start the SDK as indicated results in errors. Also, don’t use GCD’s dispatch_async to start the SDK.
Import and start the mParticle Apple SDK into Swift or Objective-C.
Swift example
import mParticle_Apple_SDK
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
// Override point for customization after application launch.
let mParticleOptions = MParticleOptions(key: ""<<<App Key Here>>>"", secret: ""<<<App Secret Here>>>"")
/* Optional - Please see the Identity page for more information on building this object
let request = MPIdentityApiRequest()
request.email = ""email@example.com""
mParticleOptions.identifyRequest = request
mParticleOptions.onIdentifyComplete = { (apiResult, error) in

}
/* Optional
mParticleOptions.onAttributionComplete = { (attributionResult, error) in
NSLog(@""Attribution Complete. attributionResults = %@"", attributionResult.linkInfo)
//Start the SDK
MParticle.sharedInstance().start(with: mParticleOptions)

}

#import <mParticle_Apple_SDK_NoLocation/mParticle.h>
#else
#import ""mParticle.h""
#endif
Then, start the SDK:
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
MParticleOptions *mParticleOptions = [MParticleOptions optionsWithKey:@""REPLACE ME"" secret:@""REPLACE ME""];
/* Optional - Please see the Identity page for more information on building this object

mParticleOptions.identifyRequest = request;
mParticleOptions.onIdentifyComplete = ^(MPIdentityApiResult * _Nullable apiResult, NSError * _Nullable error) {

};
*/
[[MParticle sharedInstance] startWithOptions:mParticleOptions];
return YES;
}
See Identity for more information about supplying an MPIdentityApiRequest object during SDK initialization.
Remember to start Metro with:
$ npm start
and build your workspace from Xcode.
Android
Use the mParticle key and secret from you copied and construct an MParticleOptions object.
Call start from the onCreate method of your app’s Application class. It’s crucial that the SDK be started here for proper session management. If you don’t already have an Application class, create it and then specify its fully-qualified name in the <application> tag of your app’s AndroidManifest.xml.
package com.example.myapp;
import andro",14,developers_client-sdks_react-native_getting-started_.txt

import com.mparticle.MParticle;
public class MyApplication extends Application {
@Override
public void onCreate() {
super.onCreate();
MParticleOptions options = MParticleOptions.builder(this)
.credentials(""REPLACE ME WITH KEY"",""REPLACE ME WITH SECRET"")
.setLogLevel(MParticle.LogLevel.VERBOSE)
//.identify(identifyRequest)
.identifyTask(
new BaseIdentityTask()
.addFailureListener(this)
.addSuccessListener(this)
)
.build();
MParticle.start(options);
}
}
Warning: It’s generally not a good idea to log events in Application.onCreate(). Android may instantiate your Application class for a lot of reasons, in the background, while the user isn’t even using their device.
Usage
After you install and initialize the SDK, you can log events. You can also set, remove, or get user details with User or Identity methods.
Import the mParticle module
Import the module:
import MParticle from 'react-native-mparticle'
Events
Log events:
MParticle.logEvent('Test event', MParticle.EventType",15,developers_client-sdks_react-native_getting-started_.txt

Log commerce events:
const product = new MParticle.Product('Test product for cart', '1234', 19.99)
const transactionAttributes = new MParticle.TransactionAttributes('Test transaction id')
const event = MParticle.CommerceEvent.createProductActionEvent(MParticle.ProductActionType.AddToCart, [product], transactionAttributes)
MParticle.logCommerceEvent(event)
const promotion = new MParticle.Promotion('Test promotion id', 'Test promotion name', 'Test creative', 'Test position')
const event = MParticle.CommerceEvent.createPromotionEvent(MParticle.PromotionActionType.View, [promotion])
MParticle.logCommerceEvent(event)
const product = new MParticle.Product('Test product that was viewed', '5678', 29.99)
const impression = new MParticle.Impression('Test impression list name', [product])
const event = MParticle.CommerceEvent.createImpressionEvent([impression])
MParticle.logCommerceEvent(event)
Log screen events:
MParticle.logScreenEvent('Test screen', { 'Tes",16,developers_client-sdks_react-native_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/react-native/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/react-native/getting-started/,"t key': 'Test value' })
Exclude App and Commerce Events from mParticle Server Upload
If you have a high-volume event that you would like to forward to kits but exclude from uploading to mParticle, set a boolean flag per event.
By default, all events upload to the mParticle server unless explicitly set not to.
// Events
var event = new MParticle.Event()
.setName('Test event')
.setType(MParticle.EventType.Other)
.setInfo({ 'Test key': 'Test value' })
.setShouldUploadEvent(false) // Set false to prevent uploading, true or omit to upload
MParticle.logMPEvent(event)
// Commerce Events
const product = new MParticle.Product('Test product for cart', '1234', 19.99)
const transactionAttributes = new MParticle.TransactionAttributes('Test transaction id')
var commerceEvent = MParticle.CommerceEvent.createProductActionEvent(MParticle.ProductActionType.AddToCart, [product], transactionAttributes)
commerceEvent.setShouldUploadEvent(false) // Set false to prevent uploading, true or omit to upload

'GA4.CommerceEventType': 'add_shipping_info',
'GA4.ShippingTier': 'overnight'
}
commerceEvent.customFlags = customFlags
MParticle.logCommerceEvent(commerceEvent)
User
To set, remove, and get user details, call the User or Identity methods as follows:
MParticle.setUserAttribute('Test key', 'Test value')
MParticle.setUserAttribute(MParticle.UserAttributeType.FirstName, 'Test first name')
MParticle.setUserAttributeArray('Test key', ['Test value 1', 'Test value 2'])
MParticle.setUserTag('Test key')
MParticle.removeUserAttribute('Test key')
IdentityRequest
var request = new MParticle.IdentityRequest()
Run a user alias anytime the user identity changes
request.onUserAlias = (previousUser, newUser) => {
console.debug(previousUser.userID);
console.debug(newUser.userID);
};
Set a user identity:
var request = new MParticle.IdentityRequest();
request.setUserIdentity('example@example.com', MParticle.UserIdentityType.Email);
Identity
MParticle.Identity.getCurrentUser((currentUser)",18,developers_client-sdks_react-native_getting-started_.txt

console.debug(currentUser.userID);
});
var request = new MParticle.IdentityRequest();
MParticle.Identity.identify(request, (error, userId) => {
if (error) {
console.debug(error); //error is an MParticleError
} else {
console.debug(userId);
}
});
var request = new MParticle.IdentityRequest();
request.email = 'test email';
MParticle.Identity.login(request, (error, userId) => {
if (error) {
console.debug(error); //error is an MParticleError
} else {
console.debug(userId);
}
});
var request = new MParticle.IdentityRequest();
MParticle.Identity.logout(request, (error, userId) => {
if (error) {
console.debug(error);
} else {
console.debug(userId);
}
});
var request = new MParticle.IdentityRequest();
request.email = 'test email 2';
MParticle.Identity.modify(request, (error, userId) => {
if (error) {
console.debug(error); //error is an MParticleError
} else {
console.debug(userId);
}
});
Attribution

Kits
Check if a kit is active:
var isKitActive = MParticle.isKitActive(kitId);
Check and set the SDK opt-out status:
var isOptedOut = MParticle.getOptOut();
MParticle.setOptOut(!isOptedOut);
Push registration
The method MParticle.logPushRegistration() accepts two parameters. For Android, provide both pushToken and senderId. For iOS, provide the push token in the first parameter, and simply pass null for the second parameter.
Android
MParticle.logPushRegistration(pushToken, senderId);
iOS
MParticle.logPushRegistration(pushToken, null);
GDPR consent
Add GDPR consent:
var gdprConsent = GDPRConsent()

Add the SDK
Get the Dependency
The SDK is hosted on Github and currently exposes a single events package:
go get github.com/mParticle/mparticle-go-sdk/events
Import the Package
import ""github.com/mParticle/mparticle-go-sdk/events""
Model Overview
Batch
All data sent via the SDK must be encapsulated in a Batch struct. Each Batch is associated with a single user. Batch objects must be associated with an environment (development or production) to properly silo your testing and production data.
//""DevelopmentEnvironment"" or ""ProductionEnvironment""
batch := events.Batch{Environment: events.DevelopmentEnvironment}
User Identities
Most use-cases require that data be associated with a user identity, for example:
If you’re also sending data to mParticle via our mobile SDKs, set a customer ID both via the mobile SDKs and this SDK so that mParticle can correctly associate data with each user.
Several marketing automation and audience integrations are powered by email.
batch.UserIdenti",10,developers_server-sdks_go_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/go/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/go/,"ties = &events.UserIdentities{
CustomerID: ""go1234"",
Email:
""go-example@foo.com"",
}
Device Information
The DeviceInformation object describes the device that should be associated with this batch. Crucially, it exposes properties for device identities (Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID) which are required for nearly all mParticle Audience integrations.
batch.DeviceInfo = &events.DeviceInformation{
IOSAdvertisingID: ""607258d9-c28b-43ad-95ed-e9593025d5a1"",
}
User Attributes
The mParticle audience platform can be powered by only sending a combination of user attributes, used to describe segments of users, and device identities/user identities used to then target those users.
# arbitrary example allowing you to create a segment of users trial users
batch.UserAttributes = make(map[string]interface{})
batch.UserAttributes[""Account type""] = ""trial""
batch.UserAttributes[""Account capabilities""] = []string{""foo"", ""bar""}
Events
Events are central to many of mParticle’s integrations; analytics i",11,developers_server-sdks_go_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/go/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/go/,"ntegrations typically require events, and you can create mParticle Audiences based on the recency and frequency of different events. All events should be associated with a timestamp reflecting when they actually occurred, otherwise they will be assigned a timestamp when mParticle receives them.
Custom Event
Custom Events represent specific actions that a user has taken in your app. At minimum they require a name and a type, but can also be associate with a free-form dictionary of key/value pairs.
customEvent := events.NewCustomEvent()
customEvent.Data.EventName = ""My Custom Event Name""
customEvent.Data.CustomEventType = events.OtherCustomEventType
customEvent.Data.CustomAttributes = make(map[string]string)
customEvent.Data.CustomAttributes[""foo""] = ""bar""
Commerce Event
The Commerce event is central to mParticle’s Commerce measurement. Commerce events can contain many data points but it’s important to understand that there are 3 core variations:
Product-based: Used to measure measured d",12,developers_server-sdks_go_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/go/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server-sdks/go/,"atapoints associated with one or more products
Promotion-base: Used to measure datapoints associated with internal promotions or campaigns
Impression-based: Used to measure interactions with impressions of products and product-listings
totalProductAmount := 10.00
totalProducts := int32(2)
product := events.Product{
TotalProductAmount: &totalProductAmount,
ID:
""product-id"",

}
Session Events
The SessionStartEvent and SessionEndEvent should be used to describe the details of user session such as its length, which is a common metric used in many mParticle integrations. Additionally, recency and frequency of sessions are powerful data-points by which an mParticle audience can be ",13,developers_server-sdks_go_.txt

sessionStartEvent.Data.SessionID = 12345678
sessionStartEvent.Data.TimestampUnixtimeMS = int32(time.Now().Unix())
sessionEndEvent := events.NewSessionEndEvent()
sessionEndEvent.Data.SessionID = 12345678
sessionEndEvent.Data.SessionDurationMS = int32(time.Now().Unix())
Consent State
To conform to the ever growing global regulations on data privacy, mParticle provides Data Privacy Controls.
Data privacy controls are initially configured in the dashboard and are attached via a batch’s consent_state.
GDPR
gdprConsentState := events.GdprConsentState{
Document:
""document_agreement.v2"",
Consented:
true,
TimestampUnixtimeMS: int32(time.Now().Unix()),
}
consentState := &events.ConsentState{
GDPR: make(map[string]GdprConsentState),
}
consentState.GDPR[""my-purpose""] = gdprConsentState
batch.ConsentState = consentState
In this example, 'My Purpose' should match the Consent Purpose defined in your mParticle GDPR settings.

The SDK exposes a Configuration struct that you can use to customize the BasePath of a request. For most use case you can just create a default Configuration with events.NewConfiguration()
All requests must be associated with a context object, containing the credentails for the request.
You must associate your context with the correct key and secret. Typically you will want to create a new “Custom Feed” input. However, you can also use “platform” keys (eg iOS/Android) directly.

Journeys help you to perform journey analysis, testing, and orchestration in a single workflow:
Your campaign needs to reach customers who are spread across many channels, or your customer data about them is coming in from many different sources.
You want to use a visual tool to create your campaign.
You want to define a series of audiences based on different criteria in order to take diffe",9,guides_personalization_journeys_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/,"rent actions as part of the same campaign.
You want to drive consistent messaging across channels and prevent duplicate targeting.
Because customers interact with your brand in many different ways at many different times, you need to reach them based on their behaviors, and reach them with a cohesive voice to deliver a personalized experience across multiple marketing channels.
You want to design a multistep journey: starting with the users available with the inputs you select, you can apply sets of criteria called milestones. At each milestone a new audience is created, which you can then send downstream for further action.
You can create as many journeys as you need (up to your active audience limit), and delete empty journeys when they are no longer useful. You can also delete milestones and their related audiences and connections from a journey and add new milestones.
Journey workflow
At the start of the journey, you have access to all the users available from all the inputs from a",10,guides_personalization_journeys_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/,"ll the workspaces in your account. You choose the workspaces and inputs you wish to select audience members from, and then build the journey:
In a series of steps called milestones, you break down all the paths taken by your users within a customer lifecycle stage. For example, let’s say that a user signs up for a trial account, interacts with free content, and then saves some content for later. Milestones define the steps that users take or that you want users to take to achieve a set of goals such as sign up, makes a purchase, or become a repeat customer.
Each milestone generates an audience that you can forward to an integration to convert users from one step to the next in their journey. Following on the previous example, if you see a drop off between “sign up to trial account” and “watches content” milestones, you can activate the trial account audiences and send it to a CRM partner to send promo emails that help attract and bring content to non-engaged users.
Keep defining milest",11,guides_personalization_journeys_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/,"ones until you’ve reached the final goal for the customer lifecycle stage. Using the previous example, the “converted to paid user” milestone is the last milestone in the journey.
Verify that the data flow is behaving as you expect using the same tools and techniques you use for an integration.
When a journey needs to be changed, you can modify or delete milestones.
The following diagram shows a simple journey with two milestones:
In this journey, all customers who engage with the app are sent an email, and those who open the email are sent a mobile push notification.
Notice the following:
The audience is displayed in a box underneath its milestone. You can connect to an output here, or view the status of the output with the down-arrow.
If it can be estimated, the audience size displays in the audience box.
The path symbol appears above each milestone, and a plus sign appears at the bottom of each milestone. Click the path symbol to split off additional paths and milestones, or click t",12,guides_personalization_journeys_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/,"he plus sign to create a new milestone on the same path.
You can tell whether an audience has been activated by the green on/off icon in the audience. If grayed out, the audience isn’t active, if green, it is.
Journey path splits
Each step in the customer journey can be split into additional paths. For example, you could define a set of milestones for customers who buy handbags, shoes, or winter coats. Each milestone becomes the start of a new path.
You can also create a milestone for all audience members that haven’t fit any previous milestone criteria. This split is called a remaining user split.
Split behaviors
The first milestone and audience definition is the left-most milestone, and milestones are added left-to-right.
Splits are mutually exclusive and evaluated left to right. Audience members are placed in the first audience where they meet the milestone criteria.
If you create a remaining user split, it displays as the last (right-most) milestone.
You can create a remaining user",13,guides_personalization_journeys_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/," split after the first milestone for a path is created.
Examples
The following three examples show the different ways you can use multiple splits.
Use predictions to reduce churn and vary customer communications
Powered by Cortex, customer-centric teams can predict a user’s likelihood to churn. Using that prediction, teams can deliver a unique set of experiences for users who have a high likelihood to churn.
In this example, a brand engages high-churn risk users on multiple channels to ensure they get the message. In addition, the brand sets up a fail safe for the users who received an email but didn’t open it, engaging them over SMS.
Engage customers in the right channel based on customer consent
One key piece of user preference is their consent status, what they’ve told the brand about how they want their data to be used for marketing purposes.
In this example, an eCommerce retailer delivers two different kinds of experiences based on a user’s consent to GDPR.
If users have consented",14,guides_personalization_journeys_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/,", the retailer sends a mobile notification as a reminder to convert. For the remaining users, those who have not consented, the retailer triggers an in-app coupon if the user returns after several days.
Trigger post-purchase sequences based on a customer’s lifetime value
For many retailers, a user’s purchase of a product is just the beginning of the relationship between the customer and the brand. After a purchase, the retailer can suggest to the customer many possible next steps to prolong and deepen that relationship: purchasing more products, leaving a review, referring a friend, posting on social media, and more.
In this example, retailers trigger the next best step based on a user’s lifetime value.
For high LTV customers, brands can assume that they’re fans of the brand, and would be more willing to refer a friend. If the retailer knows a loyal customer’s preferred engagement channel, they can communicates with them there. For the remaining users, those who are not high LTV custom",15,guides_personalization_journeys_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/,"ers, a retailer can recommend products that pair well with the one that a customer just purchased.
Audience estimator
Each audience that you create in a journey provides an estimated audience size immediately, so that you don’t have to wait for the audience calculation to complete. Once an audience has at least one active connection, audiences and all parent audiences in same path begin calculating the real size. When an audience begins calculating it no longer shows the estimated size.
To estimate the audience size quickly, mParticle samples the total number of users.
You see the estimated size of the audience with all criteria applied (as shown in the previous image). Estimated audience size per criteria is also displayed on the milestone.
Use the audience estimator’s immediate feedback to adjust criteria definitions and parameters if needed:
The audience size is much bigger or much smaller than expected.
Your team wants to explore different ways to target your customers.
You see a b",16,guides_personalization_journeys_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/journeys/,"ig drop-off of users between milestones and want to target an intermediary moment in the journey, to nudge more users toward your conversion goal.
In some cases, you may see different symbols instead of an estimated size:
The symbol ~ indicates that the population is too small relative to the overall user base, which prevents a meaningful calculation. For example, imagine a company that has 100 million users. If you create an audience that will have 13,000 members when fully calculated, it’s likely that the random sample won’t encounter enough members to be represented in the estimate. This symbol doesn’t mean your audience will have no members, just that it will have so few members relative to the total number of users that estimation isn’t possible.
If an audience can’t be estimated for a technical reason, you’ll see a red triangle with an exclamation point instead of an estimated size. For example, if the input is not configured correctly, you’ll see this warning sign.

When an audience is actively connected, that audience is activated and consumes a real-time audience credit. Unlike the real-time audience experience, there is no explicit audience status of Draft or Active. The status is now derived from the connection status.
Activated audiences count toward your account limit.
Parent audiences are calculated, but do not consume additional real-time audience credits.
To view the number of audiences available to you, in mParticle go to Audiences > Journeys to display the list of journeys. The number of activated and available audiences is displayed under the New Journey button:

Data Plans allow you to define and then validate the extent and shape of the data that is collected.

Understanding Data Points and Data Plans
For every mParticle workspace, you may have many data plans.
Every data plan contains one or more data plan versions.
Each data plan version contains data points that you have defined.
A data point is a unit of data collected by mParticle. Data points represent Events such as Custom Events or Screen Views, or User attributes such as Customer Id or Email.
Each data point includes criteria used to select the data point from an incoming data stream, and a definition called a schema that validates the contents of the data point. You can view data points in all three Data Master tools: Catalog, Live Stream, and Data Plan.
For example, here is a view of the Play Video data point in Catalog:

It encompasses the following features:
Catalog provides an overview of data collected, including detailed collection statistics. You can add descriptions and other information about data points in the catalog.
Data Plans allow you to define and then validate the extent and shape of the data that is collected.
Live Stream allows you to observe data streaming into mParticle in realtime an",9,guides_data-master_introduction_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/introduction/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/introduction/,"d to identify violations quickly if you are using a Data Plan to validate your data.
Understanding Data Points and Data Plans
For every mParticle workspace, you may have many data plans.
Every data plan contains one or more data plan versions.
Each data plan version contains data points that you have defined.
A data point is a unit of data collected by mParticle. Data points represent Events such as Custom Events or Screen Views, or User attributes such as Customer Id or Email.
Each data point includes criteria used to select the data point from an incoming data stream, and a definition called a schema that validates the contents of the data point. You can view data points in all three Data Master tools: Catalog, Live Stream, and Data Plan.
For example, here is a view of the Play Video data point in Catalog:
Here is a view of the a Commerce Event data point in Live Stream:

List view
You can use the Catalog’s List view to:
View a centralized listing of all the data points.
Spot data points which are duplicated, inconsistently named, etc.
Identify and eliminate unnecessary or redundant data points
The list view displays six main categories:
Custom Events

Application Lifecycle
Consent
The Catalog will only show a category heading if there is at least one matching data point to display. Click on any data point to see detailed information. You can also add a description directly from the list view.
Date Range, Search, and Filter
You can filter the list view to display specific data points:
Date Range: show data points that have been seen within a selected date range.
Search: show data points with a matching name or description.
Filter icon: show data points that match the criteria you specify:
Input/App Version: show data points that have been seen for the selected inputs/app versions.
Environment: show data points that have been seen in the dev or prod environments.
Channel: show data points that have been seen for the selected channel. Channel is distinct from input and describes how a data point arrived at mParticle. For example, a data point may arrive from the client side, server side, or from a partner feed. Valid channel",10,guides_data-master_catalog_.txt

Pixel
Combine date ranges and filters with your search terms to quickly browse and explore data points. Setting a filter will also clear any current category selection.
Details view
The details view gives you detailed information on an individual data point, including environments the event has been captured for, and when an event was last seen for each platform.
Users with admin access can annotate data points in the following ways:
Tags: a freeform list of labels you’d like to associate to the data point.
External Link: a link to your wiki or any other resource containing documentation about the data point
Description: a custom text field where you can describe the data point, expected attributes, how it’s used, and any other relevant information.
Additional Names: a list of alternate names the data point is known by. For example, legacy names or names from a partner feed.
Data Point Attributes

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/catalog/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/data-master/catalog/,"e details view shows every attribute name that has ever been seen within the given data point. You can see the total volume received in the last 30 days, when the attribute was last seen, and the detected data type. The supported detection types are:
String
String-list
Boolean
Number
Date-time
The data type of a new attribute defaults to string but is updated automatically as you capture more data.
Stats view
Dates and times shown on the Stats view are in UTC.
For data points, the stats view shows two important groups of statistics for a selected date:
Input stats show how many instances of the event have been received, by platform and channel.
Output stats show the volume sent to each output, as well as the delta between the number of events received and outgoing messages sent. This delta can be useful for troubleshooting, but note that the difference between volume sent and received usually doesn’t indicate a problem.

mParticle provides several SDKs and APIs allowing you to collect data from a variety of sources, like a mobile app, web app, or data feeds from other SaaS providers.
You can collect two types of data with mParticle:
Event data: data that describes what your users are doing
User data: data that describes who your users are
Learn h",9,developers_quickstart_web.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/web,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/web,"ow to integrate the Web SDK from start to finish
To demonstrate how mParticle works, you will learn how to track basic event data like page views and purchase events in a web app using the mParticle web SDK. Then, you will learn how to send that data to a webhook. You will also learn how to manage your data quality by creating a data plan.
mParticle is extremely flexible. There are thirteen SDKs for specific platforms like web, iOS, and Android, in addition to several APIs. mParticle also provides over 250 integrations with data warehouse, analytics, and marketing automation tools.
To keep your first steps with mParticle quick and easy, this tutorial uses the web SDK and a sample ecommerce app built using React called The Higgs Shop.
This is a technical tutorial for developers. If you aren’t a developer, you can find a general introduction to mParticle in the Platform Guide.
About the Web SDK
mParticle’s Web SDK supports commonly used web browsers, connected TVs, and other client-side ",10,developers_quickstart_web.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/web,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/web,"environments using JavaScript and TypeScript.
By initializing the Web SDK in your app, you gain access to useful methods you can call in your app’s code to send events and user data to mParticle.
Prerequisites
Access to an mParticle instance
In order to begin sending data from your app to mParticle, you will need access to an mParticle account and an API key.
Download the mParticle sample app
This tutorial demonstrates how mParticle works using The Higgs Shop, a sample web application built using React.
Open your terminal or command prompt, and clone the web sample app repository on GitHub.
Install the sample app
While in your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root folder of the web sample app: /mparticle-sample-apps/mparticle-web-sample-apps/core-sdk-samples/higgs-shop-sample-app
If you don’t have Node.js or npm installed, install them now. Optionally, you may also install Node Version Manager (nvm) which is a helpful tool for installing and managing different versions of No",11,developers_quickstart_web.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/web,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/web,"de.
Install the sample app’s dependencies with npm install
Open the folder /higgs-shop-sample-app in your IDE or text editor. Rename the file .env.sample to .env. We will replace the environment variable REACT_APP_MPARTICLE_API_KEY with the API Key in step 5
To run the sample app from your computer, run npm start. This will start a development server before automatically opening The Higgs Shop in a new browser window.
It may take up to 2 minutes to launch the sample app.
Since we haven’t added our API key to the sample app’s config file yet, we will receive a warning message. We will add our API key in the next step.
For now, ignore the API key warning and close the page and stop the development server in your terminal or command prompt. In the next step, we’ll create and add our API key before restarting the sample app.

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,"nceZendeskEventFeedQuadratic LabsEventZ2A DigitalEventAudienceQualtricsEventEventAppsFlyer is a leading Mobile Attribution & Marketing Analytics platform that allows app marketers to easily measure the performance of all their marketing channels - paid, organic and social - from a single real-time dashboard.
mParticle’s integration with AppsFlyer includes a required Kit integration and an optional server-side integration. The Kit forwards event data from your app to AppsFlyer on the client side, and also handles app install attribution, uninstall tracking, and deeplinking, including deferred deeplinking. Supplementary data from outside your app can be forwarded to mParticle via our Events API and sent on to AppsFlyer server-to-server.
Consent
To adhere to the EU user consent policy, starting March 6, 2024, Google is enforcing the consent field to be populated for EU users. AppsFlyer is adjusting to this requirement. You can find more details in AppsFlyer's announcement here.
Google has",14,integrations_appsflyer_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event," several notions of user-provided consent.
Two of these apply to AppsFlyer events: ad_user_data and ad_personalization. These represent consent for ad user data and ad personalization.
User-specified Consent
To configure user consent forwarding under this value, a mapping should be set-up leveraging mParticle’s notion of Consent Purposes. To learn more about handling user consent within mParticle’s platform, see the following docs: Data Privacy Controls.
Once a Consent Purpose is set up, user consent information can be associated with it in subsequent Event Batches. The Consent Purpose data mapping can then be configured for downstream forwarding via the User Consent Data Mapping connection setting.
Consent Defaults
In the absence of a user-defined consent value for the ad_user_data and ad_personalization fields via the Consent Purpose mapping, a default value can be optionally configured via a separate drop-down setting for each consent type. When no user consent is provided, the defa",15,integrations_appsflyer_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,"ult status is used, if specified.
Caution: It is recommended that in the long term, you set up user-specified consent through the Consent Purpose mapping, such that the user consent is correctly forwarded to Google. It is your responsibility as a Data Controller to stay compliant under the GDPR, and set up user consent collection for downstream forwarding. The consent default setting can be deprecated in the future.
Enabling AppsFlyer
1. Configure
Add the mParticle SDKs to your iOS and/or Android apps. See the docs for your platform here.
Connect your iOS and/or Android workspaces to AppsFlyer. You will need to provide your Dev Key, which you can access from the Settings page of your organization’s AppsFlyer dashboard. For an iOS connection, you will also need your Apple App ID. Make sure you remove the ‘ID’ prefix. For example, if your App ID is id12345, just enter 12345. For more information on setting up a new mParticle connection, see the Platform Guide.

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,"its
mParticle’s AppsFlyer integration requires that you add the AppsFlyer Kit to your iOS or Android app. Just by adding the binary to your app:
The mParticle SDK will initialize AppsFlyer’s SDK per their documentation, using the AppsFlyer dev key provided above, and will also forward all required UIApplication (iOS) and Activity (Android) lifecycle events to the AppsFlyer SDK.
Events that you log via mParticle’s API will be automatically mapped onto AppsFlyer analogous event tracking APIs.
The customer ID and email of the current user, set via mParticle’s Identity APIs, will be mapped onto AppsFlyer’s analogous setUser APIs.
Google Play Install Referrer will be forwarded (Android only - see below).
mParticle publishes the AppsFlyer Kit as separate iOS and Android libraries which have a transitive dependency on the mParticle core libraries. You can add them to your app via Carthage, Cocoapods, Swift Package Manager, or Gradle:
CocoaPods
# Sample Podfile
source 'https://github.com/Cocoa",18,integrations_appsflyer_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,"Pods/Specs.git'
target '<Your Target>' do
pod 'mParticle-AppsFlyer'
end
Carthage
github ""mparticle-integrations/mparticle-apple-integration-appsflyer"" ""~> 8.0""
Swift
To integrate the SDK using Swift Package Manager, open your Xcode project and navigate to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency
Enter the repository URL `https://github.com/mparticle-integrations/mparticle-apple-integration-appsflyer` and click Next.
You can leave the version settings as default and click Next one more time to complete adding the package dependency.
Gradle
// Sample build.gradle
dependencies {
// Ensure the Kit version matches that of the mParticle Core SDK that you're using
implementation 'com.mparticle:android-appsflyer-kit:5+'
}
Refer to the Apple SDK and Android SDK guides to read more about kits.
3. Install Referrer (Android only)
AppsFlyer’s SDK requires the forwarding of the Google Play Install Referrer Intent. The AppsFlyer kit will take care of this for you as long as you’ve added mPartic",19,integrations_appsflyer_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,"le’s ReferrerReceiver to you manifest, or you are manually forwarding the Intent to our ReferrerReceiver class. The mParticle SDK will then forward the Install Referrer intent to each configured kit, including AppsFlyer.
Please see the Android SDK setup guide to ensure your manifest is configured properly.
Deep Linking and Attribution
The AppsFlyer SDK exposes client-side deep linking and attribution APIs, all of which are supported by the mParticle AppsFlyer kit and are covered in this section. The core use-cases are:
Retrieving install attribution information (deferred deep linking)
Retrieve app-open attribution information (non-deferred deep linking)
OneLink, AppsFlyer’s unified deeplinking hosting service
Each platform has very specific requirements to ensure that the above functionality is supported. The minimum requirements are:
Verify the AppsFlyer connection is enabled for the workspace key and secret, and mParticle environment (development or production) that you’re testing.
V",20,integrations_appsflyer_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,"erify that the devKey configured above matches your AppsFlyer app.
Verify that you have correctly configured your Apple App ID (retrieve from iTunes connect, this is not your iOS development team prefix) both in AppsFlyer and in mParticle.
Verify that the proper associated domains and entitlements are configured (iOS only)
Verify that your AndroidManifest.xml has the proper Intent Filters to match any deep link domains that you’re testing.
Retrieving Attribution Information
mParticle’s SDKs will automatically initialize the AppsFlyer SDK, forwarding the required UIApplication lifecycle events and the continueUserAcivity events for iOS and Android, as well as registering a delegate such that you can retrieve deep linking and attribution parameters on the client-side to customize your user’s in-app experience.
Specifically, the AppsFlyer SDK exposes one distinct callback:
didResolveDeepLink
mParticle’s API includes a wrapper for this callback, and both the iOS and Android kits expose a c",21,integrations_appsflyer_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,"onstant to inform you when the callback has been fired and if it was successful. On both platforms, the iOS/Android kit will register a delegate/callback with the AppsFlyer SDK on initialization and for the lifetime of the app’s process, and will call your completion handler block (iOS) or AttributionListener (Android) whenever there is new conversion data available.
When a user clicks a OneLink link, the AppsFlyer SDK retrieves available OneLink data from the AppsFlyer servers. Then, the UDL API calls the didResolveDeepLink() method which returns a DeepLinkResult object containing a status and (if successful) a DeepLink object containing the deep_link_value and deep_link_sub1-10 parameters you can use to customize the resulting in-app outcome.
However, when users deep link directly using universal or app links, the didResolveDeepLink method returns the full link unparsed since the app opens directly without going through AppsFlyer first. You can read more about AppsFlyer’s deep linkin",22,integrations_appsflyer_event.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/appsflyer/event,"g methods here.
The parameters returned in these results will match the result of the AppsFlyer SDK, as documented for Android and iOS.
See the deep linking documentation for iOS and Android for more information.
Test Scenarios
The following core test scenarios that should be verified:
New user-install (deferred deeplink)
Application not running, and an existing user-install invokes a deep link (“cold start” scenario)
Application running in the background, and an existing user install invokes a deep link (“warm start” scenario)
Track Events
The AppsFlyer Kit will forward app events and eCommerce events to AppsFlyer. Custom Mappings are available to map your custom app events onto AppsFlyer’s event names. Refer to the iOS and Android SDK docs for details on instrumenting your app for event tracking:

Server Integration
mParticle can forward app events and commerce events received via our Events API to AppsFlyer’s server-API. Note that AppsFlyer requires data to be linked to a unique AppsFlyer ID, generated client-side by the AppsFlyer Kit. mParticle stores the AppsFlyer ID in its internal user profile. This means that:
You must have the AppsFlyer Kit included in your app to be able to forward data, and you can only forward data associated with your app users.
The data you send server-side must include a device ID, so that mParticle can lookup the AppsFlyer ID for the user.
The AppsFlyer Kit must be included in your app - the server integration may only be used as a complement to the Kit integration.

By contrast, real-time and standard audiences are static and based on historical data.
Create a predictive audience by specifying a user prediction in your regular audience creation workflow in mParticle. The user prediction accesses Cortex machine learning algorithms that analyze data on customer behavior, preferences, and interactions with your brands. You can use predictive audiences to anticipate the needs a",9,guides_personalization_predictive-audiences_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/predictive-audiences/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/predictive-audiences/,"nd desires of your target audiences, and thus deliver more relevant and personalized messaging. Predictive audiences maximize impact by automatically finding the best-fit users for a desired outcome.
Example
In the past, you created a static (real-time) audience that identifies every user who has viewed shoes two or more times in the last week, and sent a coupon to all those users. However, now you can create a goal-oriented, predictive audience that contains all the users most likely to purchase shoes based on an analysis of all the available information, not just one factor (purchased shoes twice before).
Score and percentile values
When you create a predictive audience, you can choose between two types of results:
score, the likelihood of an audience member performing a future event
percentile, the likelihood of an audience member performing a future event as compared to other users scored by Cortex, mParticle’s machine-learning engine: typically the number of active users in the la",10,guides_personalization_predictive-audiences_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/predictive-audiences/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/predictive-audiences/,"st 90 days
For example, if you wanted to know how likely it is that a user will purchase shoes in the next 7 days, you could see that likelihood displayed as a score or percentile:
With a score of 80%, the user has an 80% chance of purchasing shoes.
With a percentile value of .9, the user is more likely to purchase than 90% of users.
How it works
Creating a predictive audience is simple:
Create an audience using the same criteria builder that you use for any audience or journey creation.
In the criteria builder, select User Prediction and fill in the requested information.
When you save the audience, mParticle creates two user attributes for the user prediction, one expressed as a score and the other as a percentile. Choose one.
mParticle populates your audience. After a delay of up to 24 hours, your audience is available for use.
Connect the output to the forwarding destinations as you do for real-time audiences.
For step-by-step instructions, see Using Predictive Audiences.

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/predictive-audiences/,https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/predictive-audiences/,"ns are rerun weekly to regenerate fresh predictions.
Limitations
Predictions created in mParticle have the following limitations:
Predictions can only be created for custom and commerce event types.
Predictions use the future event prediction model in Cortex.

mParticle provides several SDKs and APIs allowing you to collect data from a variety of sources, like a mobile app, web app, or data feeds from other SaaS providers.
You can collect two types of data with mParticle:
Event data: data that describes what your users are doing
User data: data that describes who your users are
Learn h",9,developers_quickstart_android.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/android,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/android,"ow to integrate the Android SDK from start to finish
To demonstrate how mParticle works, you will learn how to track basic event data like page views and purchase events in a web app using the mParticle Android SDK. Then, you will learn how to send that data to a webhook. You will also learn how to manage your data quality by creating a data plan.
mParticle is extremely flexible. There are thirteen SDKs for specific platforms like web, iOS, and Android, in addition to several APIs. mParticle also provides over 250 integrations with data warehouse, analytics, and marketing automation tools.
To keep your first steps with mParticle quick and easy, this tutorial uses the Android SDK and a sample ecommerce app called The Higgs Shop.
This is a technical tutorial for developers. If you aren’t a developer, you can find a general introduction to mParticle in the Platform Guide.
About the Android SDK
mParticle’s Android SDK supports all Android devices and tablets, including Amazon Fire TV.
By i",10,developers_quickstart_android.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/android,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/android,"nitializing the Android SDK in your app, you gain access to useful methods you can call in your app’s code to send events and user data to mParticle.
Prerequisites
Access to an mParticle instance
In order to begin sending data from your app to mParticle, you will need access to an mParticle account and an API key.
Download the mParticle sample app
This tutorial demonstrates how mParticle works using The Higgs Shop, a sample Android application written in the Kotlin programming language.
Open your terminal or command prompt, and clone the Android sample app repository on GitHub.
Open the sample app in your IDE and configure your virtual device
If you don’t already have Android Studio installed on your computer, download and install the correction version for your OS now. You may use another IDE, but we recommend Android Studio.
Open your cloned directory for the Android sample app in Android Studio or your IDE of choice.
If you haven’t configured a virtual device to emulate the sample a",11,developers_quickstart_android.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/android,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/quickstart/android,"pp in, click the Device Manager button in the top tool bar.
Click Create device.
Select a device category and name in the modal window. We recommend Phone and any version of Pixel. Click Next.
Select or download one of the recommended system images and click Next.
After entering an AVD Name for your configuration, select the Portrait orientation (selected by default), and click Finish.
With your new virtual device configured, click Run in the top toolbar to ensure that you can successfully build the sample app.
It may take up to 2 minutes to launch the sample app.
Since you haven’t added your API key and secret to the sample app yet, you will receive a warning message. You will generate and add your API key and secret in the next step.
For now, ignore the API key warning that appears. In the next step, you will create and add your API key and secret before restarting the sample app.

Navigate to the releases section and download the latest tagged source, or clone the repository.
Create an mparticle/ directory inside the pkg:/source/ directory.
Copy mParticleBundle.crt and mParticleCore.brs into the newly created pkg:/source/mparticle directory.

Scene Graph Channels
The Scene Graph SDK allows for running mParticle entirely in a separate thread for better performance, upload batching, and more accurate session management. You should include a single mParticle Task in every scene in your channel.
1. Configure mParticle
When creating a new scene, include the mParticle credentials and options as the mparticleOptions field of the scene’s Global Node. mParticleTask.brs will look for this and automatically initialize mParticle for you.
sub main(args as dynamic)
screen = CreateObject(""roSGScreen"")
m.port = CreateObject(""roMessagePort"")
screen.setMessagePort(m.port)
scene = screen.CreateScene(""HelloWorld"")
options = {}
options.apiKey = ""REPLACE WITH API KEY""
options.apiSecret =

'If you know the users credentials, supply them here
'otherwise the SDK will use the last known identities
identityApiRequest = {userIdentities:{}}
'Note that you must specifically use the 'userIdentities' key
identityApiRequest.userIdentities[mparticleConstants().IDENTITY_TYPE.EMAIL] = ""user@example.com""
identityApiRequest.userIdentities[mparticleConstants().IDENTITY_TYPE.CUSTOMER_ID] = ""123456""
'Note that you must specifically use the 'identifyRequest' key
options.identifyRequest = identityApiRequest
'REQUIRED: mParticle will look for mParticleOptions in the global node

screen.show()

If you plan to use proxy tools such as Charles Proxy for testing in your development build, you may wish to disable SSL pinning. To do so, insert the following line at the end of the options section (after options.apiSecret = ""REPLACE WITH API SECRET""):
options.enablePinning = false
2. Include mParticleCore.brs in your Scene
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?>
<component name=""HelloWorld"" extends=""Scene"">
...
<!-- Replace with correct path if necessary -->
<script type=""text/brightscript"" uri=""pkg:/source/mparticle/mParticleCore.brs""/>
</component>
3. Create the mParticle Task Node:
Once you’ve added the mParticle Task to your scene, you can use the mParticleSGBridge() helper to make all calls to mParticle.
sub init()
'Create the mParticle Task Node
m.mParticleTask = createObject(""roSGNode"",""mParticleTask"")
'Use the mParticle task node to create an instance an mParticleSGBridge
mp = mParticleSGBridge(m.mParticleTask)
end sub
Legacy Channels
Initialize the SDK within your ",12,developers_client-sdks_roku_getting-started_.txt

In addition to your mParticle credentials, you must pass a reference to the message port of your main run loop, such that mParticle can make asynchronous network requests.
Within your main run loop, inspect the source identity and pass roUrlEvent objects to mParticle per the example below.
sub main(args as dynamic)
screen = CreateObject(""roPosterScreen"")
port = CreateObject(""roMessagePort"")
screen.SetMessagePort(port)
screen.ShowMessage(""Hello mParticle!"")
screen.Show()
options = {}
options.logLevel = mparticleConstants().LOG_LEVEL.DEBUG
options.apiKey = ""REPLACE WITH API KEY""
options.apiSecret = ""REPLACE WITH API SECRET""
options.startupArgs = args
'If you know the users credentials, supply them here
'otherwise the SDK will use the last known identities
identityApiRequest = {userIdentities:{}}
'Note that you must specifically use the 'userIdentities' key
identityApiRequest.userIdentities[mparticleConstants().IDENTI",13,developers_client-sdks_roku_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/roku/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/roku/getting-started/,"TY_TYPE.EMAIL] = ""user@example.com""
identityApiRequest.userIdentities[mparticleConstants().IDENTITY_TYPE.CUSTOMER_ID] = ""123456""
'Note that you must specifically use the 'identifyRequest' key
options.identifyRequest = identityApiRequest
mParticleStart(options, port)
while true
msg = Wait(0, port)
if type(msg) = ""roUrlEvent""
if mparticle().isMparticleEvent(msg.getSourceIdentity())
mparticle().onUrlEvent(msg)
end if
else if type(msg) = ""roPosterScreenEvent""
if msg.isScreenClosed()
exit while
end if
end if
end while
screen.Close()
end sub
The above will initialize the SDK, creating an mParticle install and user session.
See Identity for more information on the identityApiRequest.
Using the SDK
If using the legacy Roku SDK, you can reference mParticle directly via mParticle() anytime after you’ve called mParticleStart() as shown above. With Scene Graph, you must send messages to the mParticle Task thread over the mParticleSGBridge. mParticleSGBridge provides an API that mirrors the direct ",14,developers_client-sdks_roku_getting-started_.txt
mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/roku/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/roku/getting-started/,"mParticle API, and will generate messages for you:
'For legacy SDK channels
mp = mparticle()
'For Scene Graph channels
mp = mParticleSGBridge(m.mParticleTask)
'The event APIs are the same for both Legacy and Scene Graph
mp.logEvent(""hello world!"")
Development vs. Production Environment
All integrations in mParticle can be configured either for development data, production data, or both. The mParticle Roku SDK will automatically detect at runtime whether a channel is a debug channel, and if so will mark data as development data. You may also override this (as well as other settings) via the options associative array referenced in the snippets above. See the DEFAULT_OPTIONS object within mParticleCore.brs for the complete list of customizable settings.

Custom Events represent specific actions that a user has taken in your channel. At minimum they require a name, but can also be associated a type, and a free-form dictionary of key/value pairs:
' defaults to CUSTOM_EVENT_TYPE.OTHER and no custom attributes
mp.logEvent(""example"")
' or you can specify the custom event type and any custom attributes
customAttributes = {""example custom attribute"" : ""example custom attribute value""}
mp.logEvent(""hello world!"", mparticleConstants().CUSTOM_EVENT_TYPE.NAVIGATION, customAttributes)
Screen Events
Screen events are a special case of event specifically designed to represent the viewing of a screen. Several mParticle integrations support special functionality (e.g. funnel analysis) based on screen events.
mp.logScreenEvent(""hello screen!"")
eCommerce Events
The CommerceEvent is central to mParticle’s eCommerce measurement. CommerceEvents can contain many data points but it’s important to understand that there are 3 core variations:

mparticle,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/roku/getting-started/,https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/client-sdks/roku/getting-started/,": Used to measure measured datapoints associated with one or more products, such as a purchase.
Promotion-based: Used to measure datapoints associated with internal promotions or campaigns
Impression-based: Used to measure interactions with impressions of products and product-listings
The SDK provides a series of helpers and builders to create CommerceEvents. One of the simplest and most common scenarios would be to log a PURCHASE product action event:
mpConstants = mparticleConstants()
product = mpConstants.Product.build(""foo-product-sku"", ""foo-product-name"", 123.45)
productAction = mpConstants.ProductAction.build(actionApi.ACTION_TYPE.PURCHASE, 123.45, [product])
mp.logCommerceEvent(productAction)
Setting Integration Attributes
Occasionally certain integrations will require data that can only be provided client side. The ‘setIntegrationAttribute’ method allows clients to provide this data.

This document details the process of utilizing Lytics' real-time personalization engine to showcase content that resonates with a visitor's interests. This can be implemented directly inline or through a pop-up modal on your website to boost engagement.
Background
How does Lytics make content recommendations?
Lytics Interest Engines provides a sophisticated approach for businesses to gain and leverage insights into which content is most likely to resonate based on behavioral patterns. This is achieved through a detailed enrichment and affinity generation process in real-time. While full details are available in Lytics' comprehensive documentation, the core process can be distilled into four key steps:
Tracking Interactions: Monitoring visitor behavior in real-time to understand their engagement with the site.
Content",6,docs_guide-content-recommendations.txt
lytics,Content Recommendations,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/guide-content-recommendations," Analysis & Topic Extraction: Using Google NLP and proprietary algorithms, Lytics automatically analyzes all the content on your website, translating it into a detailed topic graph.
Interest Scoring: Assigning scores to reflect a visitor's level of interest in different topics, updated dynamically as new interactions occur.
Content Recommendation: Suggesting content that aligns with the visitor's demonstrated interests, leveraging real-time insights for timely and relevant engagement.
This streamlined framework enables real-time personalization, enhancing user experience by continuously adapting to evolving visitor interests.
Why is it important?
Relevant content for individual users boosts marketing effectiveness and ROI by increasing engagement and conversion rates. Personalized content meets users' interests, leading to better resource utilization and higher customer retention. This targeted strategy enhances sales opportunities and brand perception, directly improving return on inv",7,docs_guide-content-recommendations.txt

See it in action.
Lytics' real-time personalization engine lets you first identify the current web visitor, programmatically review their profile, and deliver one or more pieces of content based on their unique interests to maximize engagement.
Instructions
Below, you'll find a detailed guide on how to execute this use case. At the end, you'll find additional reading, which will help you learn how to extend and customize this use case further.
Requirements
Have access to an active Lytics account.
Lytics account must have had enough time to build the topic graph. Typically, 24 to 48 hours.
Ability to add JavaScript to your website via tag manager or CMS.
Entry-level knowledge of JavaScript. (Don't worry; it is mostly ""copy and paste"" here.)
Install Lytics Core SDK
Before executing this use case, your website must be properly configured with the core Lytics SDK (JavaScript tag). Please refer to our installation documentation to confirm the tag is present before continuing.
Inter",8,docs_guide-content-recommendations.txt
lytics,Content Recommendations,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/guide-content-recommendations,"est Scores & Content Collections
Your content must be classified before Lytics can offer content recommendations or insights. Typically, this classification process takes 24 to 48 hours, though it may extend if your catalog is particularly large. To ensure the health of your content graph and interest engines, there are a few key areas to focus on:
Verify Interest Scores on Profile
Ensure the Lytics Developer Tools Chrome extension is installed and Enabled.
Visit the domain(s) that have the Lytics JavaScript SDK installed.
Open the Chrome extension and navigate to the Profile section at the bottom.
From the Summary tab, you will see a section labeled Interests. Here, we will list any topics and their associated level for the user. If your user gets a message ""No interests are available,"" proceed to the next step to ensure content has been classified.
Verify Content has Been Classified
📘If you have not already verified the quality of classification and metadata, please refer to our quic",9,docs_guide-content-recommendations.txt
lytics,Content Recommendations,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/guide-content-recommendations,"kstart documentation.
From the Lytics interface, navigate to Decision Engine from the product switcher at the top left.
Using the left-hand menu, navigate to Content > Collections.
From the list of collections, there is likely only one; look for All Content in the list and the rows Size. This refers to the number of documents classified; it should be greater than one and reflect your total catalog.
For greater detail, you can also visit Content > Web Classification.
At the top of that page will be a summary dashboard of all content that has been successfully classified and cataloged. Most notably, the All Documents count under the URL Path component.
Troubleshooting Common Problems
I have no lytics_content_enrich stream. (coming soon)
My content is not showing up at all. (coming soon)
My content is being classified, but none of my documents have images. (coming soon)
Select a content collection.
We will use the default collection outlined below for this exercise, but you may also creat",10,docs_guide-content-recommendations.txt
lytics,Content Recommendations,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/guide-content-recommendations,"e a custom collection with a subset of your content to recommend.
CollectionDescriptionall_contentThis collection contains all classified documents. It comes out of the box in all Lytics accounts.
📘Ready to go a step farther and build a custom collection of your content to ensure recommendations are selected from a more currated set of documents? Check out our full documentation.
Activate Required Attributes & Segments
As an admin user of Lytics, you can enable or disable any attributes from being surfaced to the web via our JavaScript SDK. Depending on how your account has been configured, you may need to allow some of the required attributes for this particular use case.
Required Attributes:
SegmentDescriptionallWe will use the out-of-the-box segment containing all your site's users for demonstration. We recommend using something more refined in production, such as new or high-value visitors.

Enforce two-factor auth.
Ensure all account users leverage two-factor authentication.
Two-factor authentication is a technique that helps to make your account more secure. It does this by adding a second step to your login process.
Single-factor authentication uses your email address and password to authenticate your Lytics session.
The second factor comes from the Authy app using an Authy SoftToken, a secret token that changes every 20 seconds. Entering a correct token provides an extra level of verification.
What is an Authy SoftToken
An Authy SoftToken is a secret token that is broadcast to the Authy app every 20 seconds. This unique token serves as a second factor by which Lytics can authenticate your session. Authy is available to download for free as a desktop and mobile app: Download Authy.
Using Two-Factor Authentication

Using Two-Factor Authentication also requires every user to provide their phone number. Logging in with two-factor authentication for the first time will walk a user through this workflow.

Merge statistics in Lytics provide a way to monitor and optimize the merging process, ensuring that the data is adequately combined and reflects the most up-to-date and accurate information.
In the example below, you can see how merge stats can be used to uncover potential areas of issue. Out of the four available identifiers, user_id, is not responsible for any merges. This could be due to several reasons, such as no data populating that field, the relationship being defined inaccurately, etc.

A Data Model is used by Cloud Connect to link or ""connect"" a user's external data warehouse to Lytics profiles. Each Data Model represents a set of records defined by a SQL query. Each Data Model will also configure a join key which defines how the Data Model is joined to Lytics Profiles.
Once a Connection to your data warehouse has been created, Data Models can be created via the
Data Models tab within the navigation bar:
Creating a Data Model
Click + Create New
from the Data Models dashboard and complete the following steps.
Select the Connection.
Write the SQL query.
Query Editor: Write and test standard SQL queries directly in Lytics. Alternatively, copy and paste queries you've tested in your BigQuery or Snowflake instance. When you click Test Query, Lytics will return 10 sample records.

Configure the Data Model.
Name: Data Model name
Description: The Description of the Data Model.
Slug: The Data Model name that will be used in the membership and activation fields in the audience builder. It is important that the name chosen here makes sense for those building audiences in the tool. If no slug is selected, it will auto-populate using the model name.
Primary Key: Select the data warehouse ID that will be used to match against profiles in Lytics.
External Lytics Key: Select a Lytics user profile field that is a unique identifier to map to an identifier in your incoming data source.
Activated Fields:Select the fields you want to bring into Lytics profiles for activation. Note that each data model can only include 25 columns as activated fields.
Sync Frequency: Select a time interval to run the query on - this is also the frequency that your Lytics profiles will be updated. The beta options are currently every 1 hour to every 3 weeks.

lytics,Data Models & Queries,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/creating-cloud-connect-audiences,"new Lytics profile: Check this box if you want to create new profiles in Lytics if a profile with a matching ID does not already exist in Lytics. If you do not select this check box, only users with matching IDs to the Data Model IDs will be updated.
Activate the Model. Until the Data Model is activated, its SQL query will not be run against your data warehouse and Lytics profiles will not be updated with the selected fields.
📘When building multiple Cloud Connect Data Models with the same primary key, you must select the same External Lytics Key mapping. Selecting a different Lytics key will result in an error when you try to save the new Data Model.
Example Use Case
Consider this scenario to demonstrate why you'd want to create a Cloud Connect Data Model driven audience instead of a standard Lytics audience. Your company sells e-bikes and wants to run a holiday campaign that sends a promotion to any customer who purchased an e-bike in November or December last year. Perhaps you also w",8,docs_creating-cloud-connect-audiences.txt
lytics,Data Models & Queries,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/creating-cloud-connect-audiences,"ant to refine your audience to those who are interested in particular bike brands. All of this purchase and product data already exists in your Google BigQuery instance (as shown below).
Instead of directly importing all that purchase history data into Lytics, you can write a SQL query to find which customers meet this audience criteria. By copying this query directly into the Lytics Model Builder (as shown in the generate a query screenshot above), you'll create a new audience in Lytics that will be updated on the frequency interval you decide.
Once the Data Model is activated, profiles will be updated with a membership field that can be used to create an audience. Activated fields can be added to the Data Model that can then be used for more dynamic audiences.

Identity ranks in Lytics are critical to the platform's identity resolution capabilities. In Lytics, a user's identity is based upon many unique identifiers that are used to connect data across different sources. This allows businesses to comprehensively view the user's behavior and preferences, which can be used to create targeted and personalized marketing campaigns.
Identity ranks provide a way to emphasize one identifier over the other in the case of conflicts or uncertainties during the stitching or independent events into a profile.
Managing Ranks
Lytics makes managing ranks easy. Press the up or down arrow for a specific identifier to move it up or down in the list.
🚧Altering ranks without a clear intent can cause unexpected outcomes. When managing ranks it is always best to consult with your primary technical contact",6,docs_identity-key-ranks.txt

What is a “sync” in the context of Cloud Connect?
A sync refers to the process of running SQL queries configured on Data Models against data warehouses and then updating Lytics profiles with any changes that have occurred since the previous sync.
Will my SQL query only be run once per sync?
Most of the time, yes. However, if an interruption occurs during the sync (either due to a processing or network error), we’ll attempt to resume the sync from the place where we left off. If that occurs, we’ll need to rerun the query.
Why are the sync times slightly different than what I’d expect?
On the Data Model Details page, we display two timestamps related to the sync for your Data Model: “Last Sync on” and “Next Sync On”. The “Last Sync On” timestamp displays the exact time when ",6,docs_cloud-connect-troubleshooting-and-faqs.txt
lytics,Cloud Connect Troubleshooting and FAQs,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/cloud-connect-troubleshooting-and-faqs,"your Data Model was last synced. However, the timestamp shown for “Next Sync On” will vary slightly from the time when your model will actually sync.
In an effort to reduce the number of syncs needed, we set the “Next Sync On” timestamp in a way where more models will end up synced together. Then every hour, we check to see which models are ready to sync - if “Next Sync on” is in the past, we sync the model.
Ultimately, you should think of your selected sync frequency as the number of times per day your model will sync (e.g. a model with a sync frequency of four hours will sync six times per day). The “Next Sync on” timestamp gives an estimate as to when the next sync will occur rather than the exact time.
Data Models
Why can’t I create a Data Model that returns no rows?
We use the columns returned by the SQL query to set up our internal schema. If no data is returned by the query, we don’t have the required information to correctly set up our schema. Note that once the schema is set u",7,docs_cloud-connect-troubleshooting-and-faqs.txt
lytics,Cloud Connect Troubleshooting and FAQs,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/cloud-connect-troubleshooting-and-faqs,"p, your Data Model will continue to sync regardless of how many rows are returned.
Why can’t I create/update a Data Model when my schema has unpublished changes?
Creating a Data Model modifies your Conductor schema - at a minimum, a true/false “membership” field will be added to denote whether a profile falls into that Data Model. In addition, one field is added for each activated field that’s selected. In order for these fields to be added, your Conductor schema cannot be in a draft state.
When updating a Data Model, we’ll attempt to update your Conductor schema if any activated fields are being changed. For this reason, if you try to edit your activated fields and your schema has unpublished changes, we’ll reject the update.
Can I select any field as the primary key?
The UI allows for selecting any column that’s returned by your SQL query as your primary key. However, it’s important that the selected primary key field contain unique values. If there are duplicate values, we cannot gu",8,docs_cloud-connect-troubleshooting-and-faqs.txt
lytics,Cloud Connect Troubleshooting and FAQs,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/cloud-connect-troubleshooting-and-faqs,"arantee that the values for your activated fields will be correct.
You should choose a field whose values will match to the values of an existing “by” field in your Lytics schema.
Can I select any field as the Lytics key?
No; only “by” fields can be selected. Further, once a Data Model has been created for a certain primary key, all subsequent Data Models which use that primary key must also use that same Lytics key.
Sync Failures Related To Collation
Cloud Connect requires that the column you use as the primary key of your data model queries be UTF-8 collated. If your column is collated differently, this can cause your data model syncs to fail. Most database providers allow columns to be converted to a particular collation within a query. If your primary key column is collated differently, consult the documentation of your database provider to ensure a compatible collation:

lytics,Single Sign-On,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/single-sign-on-overview,"ge CampaignRecommend Content CampaignCampaign ReportingCampaign ManagementBuilding Audiences with Campaign DataSingle Sign-On Suggest Edits🚧Lytics supports Single Sign-On (SSO) by using Google Cloud Identity Platform as a service provider using SAML protocol. Lytics integrates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the Service Provider (SP) initiates SSO. IDP-initiated SSO has been deprecated and is no longer supported by Lytics.
Overview
Single Sign-On (SSO) allows employees to safely and securely access a host of Internet tools with a single username and password. There are four primary reasons why your business should consider leveraging Single Sign-On:
SSO helps the end user. Implementing SSO means employees are required to commit just one password to memory. With one password to remember, a user can easily create and remember a unique and secure password without writing it down. SSO reduces password fatigue and frustration and makes the employee more efficient.
SSO bene",6,docs_single-sign-on-overview.txt
lytics,Single Sign-On,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/single-sign-on-overview,"fits the company. Fewer passwords to remember equals fewer calls to the helpdesk, resulting in more time spent on other tasks for both the end user and IT. Fewer calls to the helpdesk (which is oftentimes outsourced) means a reduction in cost to the company as well.
SSO improves security. When employees are required to remember numerous passwords, it is easy to fall into lazy habits, such as using simple, easy-to-remember passwords, which are more susceptible to hacking. Or writing passwords down on Post-it notes where they can easily be stolen or fall into the wrong hands.
SSO helps with compliance. SSO helps companies increase control over the user's access to certain information as well as easily enforce password change policies. This makes it simpler for organizations to comply with HIPAA, SOX, and other regulatory groups.
SP-Initiated SSO
Lytics supports enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) by using Google Cloud Identity Platform as a service provider using SAML protocol. Lytics integr",7,docs_single-sign-on-overview.txt
lytics,Single Sign-On,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/single-sign-on-overview,"ates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the Service Provider (SP) initiates SSO.
Once implemented, users will log in to Lytics via a special SSO form that only requires an email address. Lytics will recognize the email address and open a pop-up to the user's IdP to complete the login. Once the IdP verifies credentials, the pop-up will close, redirecting the user to a logged-in instance of their Lytics dashboard. Behind the scenes, a customer's IdP will communicate with the Lytics APIs, which use Google Cloud Identity Platform to validate the login. This document describes the process for integrating with a new IdP that uses SAML.
Service Provider Configuration
To configure SAML for the Lytics service provider, some information is required about your IdP. If you have a metadata file that contains SAML provider information, this may be appropriate, but please ensure that the following information is provided to Lytics Support:
Entity ID
Sign In URL
X509 Signing Certificate",8,docs_single-sign-on-overview.txt
lytics,Single Sign-On,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/single-sign-on-overview,"
Further configuration details, such as mappings, may need to be provided, but the Lytics implementation only requires the email address field to be mapped. Once this information has been received, Lytics can configure the SAML connection in the Google Cloud Identity Platform.
IdP Configuration
After Lytics configures the SAML connection on the service provider, Lytics Support will provide the following key fields of information to the customer to complete the configuration in their IdP.
Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL (aka postback or callback URL)
Entity ID of the Service Provider
Sign-in URL
With this information, your IdP connection can be configured to complete the SSO integration.
📘At this time, Lytics does not support providing this information in an XML metadata file. Additional information about the Service Provider may be provided on request.
Testing SSO
Once all the information has been configured in both the IdP and the Lytics service provider, you can test and verify ",9,docs_single-sign-on-overview.txt
lytics,Single Sign-On,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/single-sign-on-overview,"that the SSO implementation works as expected. If you are using SSO as your only sign-in method, please disable any password restriction or expiration settings that may have been enabled in the UI.
During the testing process, Lytics can be configured to allow both SSO login and regular username and password (or Google OAuth) login through the app. This allows users to test SSO without disrupting the day-to-day usage of the app.
If requested, once the SSO implementation has been tested and verified, Lytics can disable the use of other login types for an account.
Troubleshooting SSO
If it's known that SSO will be added to an account, the user email addresses added to the account should match the email address present within the IdP. If the email address doesn’t match, the login will fail as Lytics will not be able to verify that there is a user with that email address.
For instance, if the email listed in the IdP is abc@123 and within Lytics, it is def@456, then there will be potentially",10,docs_single-sign-on-overview.txt
lytics,Single Sign-On,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/single-sign-on-overview," multiple error points for a user trying to log in via the SSO form on Lytics.
If the user enters abc@123 into the IdP pop-up, it will immediately fail as we use the Lytics account user to determine which IdP to redirect to. You would see an error message like the following:
However, should the user enter def@456 (their Lytics account email), they will be redirected to their IdP, but the verification of the login will fail once information is sent back to Lytics.
To remedy this situation, you would need to create a new user within Lytics with the email address abc@123 for the SSO login to be successful.
You can check, add, and remove users for an account using the Managing Users guide as a reference.
Lytics Support can assist in the troubleshooting process. When testing for the first time, Lytics can enable logging to help troubleshoot any issues you encounter. With this, the team can help debug if you provide information on the login attempt, such as the login time, user, and account.",11,docs_single-sign-on-overview.txt
lytics,Single Sign-On,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/single-sign-on-overview,"
If you’re encountering a verification error, but you've checked that your emails from the IdP and Lytics match, this may be an issue with the SAML configuration either on the IdP or SP side. Contact Lytics Support with details of the issue, and our team can coordinate a fix.
Account Structure with SSO
It should also be noted that primary accounts (master accounts) are decided as the first account that a user was added to.
Due to this,
users from a single group/organization will often have different primary accounts. This is important for SSO as it will also be the account the user is logged into at the start of their session. If SSO is enabled as the only means of login on one account and a user attempts to log in using Google OAuth or their username and password, the login session will fail. The following options are possible solutions:
Add that user to your IdP.
Add other logging methods (Google OAuth, username/password).
Remove that user from all accounts and then add them back, wi",12,docs_single-sign-on-overview.txt
lytics,Single Sign-On,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/single-sign-on-overview,"th the first account being the one you want to be their primary account.
Assigning Roles using SSO
Configuring Role Assertions for SSO in Lytics
The Lytics team can configure Single Sign-On (SSO) to assign roles via SSO. This configuration must be applied to the primary (master) accounts and any additional accounts to which users need access. For more information, refer to the account structure with SSO.
Important Note:
Users cannot be assigned to additional accounts via SSO alone; they must be manually invited to each Lytics account to which they need access.
To set up role assignments via SSO, customers must configure their Identity Provider (IDP) to include a group assertion for each account the user can access. The role of each user must be specified in the format:
lytics_<AID>_<Role>
Example of a SAML assertion for a user whose default account is 123 and also has access to account 234:

As the landscape of data strategies within the Customer Data Platform (CDP) area progresses, cloud warehouses have emerged as a core element of the overarching marketing technology (martech) strategy. Centralizing customer data in a single repository enables enhanced, comprehensive customer insights while reducing exposure and failure points throughout the data pipeline.
Nonetheless, this centralization poses the challenge of effectively leveraging this wealth of data across the martech stack for maximum value with minimal risk of additional data exposure and duplication.
How it Works
Lytics has developed the Cloud Connect product to address this, which serves as a materialized layer atop the cloud warehouse and facilitates direct segmentation and activation.
This model allows c",6,docs_lytics-zero-copy-with-cloud-connect.txt
lytics,Lytics Zero Copy with Cloud Connect,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lytics-zero-copy-with-cloud-connect,"ustomers to employ either SQL or AI to craft consumer audiences, which can subsequently be activated downstream.
Importantly, this method does not involve long-term data storage within Lytics but instead generates a transient profile context that disappears once the Cloud Connect model is deleted.
Advantages of This Approach
This strategy leverages the Zero Copy approach, utilizing Lytics' identification and data science capabilities. Hence, it transcends the limitations of data stored in the customer warehouse. Cloud Connect audiences can be enriched with Lytics' behavioral scores, profile affinities, content recommendations, and predictive models alongside Lytics' top-tier identity solution. Consequently, Lytics' customers can implement a dynamic, maintenance-light activation strategy over time.Updated 11 months ago Table of Contents

Schema Copilot revolutionizes how users manage data connections, streamlining the integration process with our Customer Data Platform (CDP), Lytics.
Before starting this document, it is important to understand some key fundamentals regarding fields and mappings, which can be found here.
Streamlined Data Integration Process
Integrating custom data into Lytics is simplified into two straightforward steps:
Schema Definition: Outline the schema to dictate how your new data source should update existing customer profiles.
Data Stream Creation: Establish a new data stream tailored to your source to ensure seamless data flow.
Features of Schema Copilot
Schema Copilot leverages advanced generative artificial intelligence to comprehensively scrutinize your new data source. It offers intuitive suggestions for fields and mappings, enabling seamless in",6,docs_schema-copilot.txt
lytics,Schema Copilot,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/schema-copilot,"tegration of your new data source with the existing schema. This intelligent assistance ensures that your data aligns perfectly with the Lytics platform, enhancing your customer data integration's overall efficiency and accuracy.
Getting Started
To get started with Schema Copilot:
Navigate to the Schema Copilot wizard.
Fill out the ""Provide Data"" box with an example of your data source's data, either JSON or CSV. In the ""Additional Prompt"" box, you can also give the model more directives.
JSON Example
Tip: If you do not correctly input the JSON, you will see an error message on the red banner.
CSV Example
Select the stream from which the data is going to be coming in.
(Optional)If you would like to have more complex data types or only map data in certain conditions you can do that using the ""Additional Prompt Box""
Example of Adding a prompt based on the CSV file input:
Now, on the email mapping for the default stream, you will see a condition that requires the first name to exist.
Clic",7,docs_schema-copilot.txt
lytics,Schema Copilot,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/schema-copilot,"k ""Suggest Schema"" and review the suggestions in the editable data grid. If you want to accept the suggestions, click ""Save Schema."" If you don't, you can return to the first step to change your data or prompt or exit the wizard entirely.
Understanding the Suggested Schema View:
Field rows will have the following columns:
Field Name: The field's name being added or updated. If there is a green dot on this row, the field is new; if the dot is yellow, then the field already exists and is being updated. The lock next to the field indicates that this is an identifier and, therefore, cannot be edited as it would impact the integrity of the profiles already built.
Type: This will indicate the data type. To better understand Lytics Field data types, please visit here.
Merge Op: This will indicate how data merges into this field over time and is defined here.
Description: This is the short description of the field and will act as the field name for the audience builder.
Is Identifier: This wil",8,docs_schema-copilot.txt
lytics,Schema Copilot,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/schema-copilot,"l indicate whether it is an identifier.
Mappings: The number of mappings recommended for the field based on
Mappings will have the following columns:
Stream: This will be the data source that will populate the mapping. In the example above, the stream is ""default,"" Lytics Jstag's default stream.
Expression:
This is where additional aggregation, cleansing, hashing, string parsing, and manipulation can be done using LQL. Adding more context to the ""Additional Prompt"" Section will automatically populate some expressions. To learn more about what expressions are available, please look here.
Condition: Additional logic should be used to decide if the data should map. This will use the LQL syntax.
Once the suggestions are saved, you can publish the changes by clicking ""Publish Changes"" on your Schema Dashboard.

If you don’t see your ads or marketing tool in our integrations list we offer the following options to connect with other platforms. With our Integration Options we enable flexibility across the various channels where your data exists and tools to build customized integrations. Lytics Integration Options include:
Webhooks
Lytics File Service integrations for server-to-server file transfer
Javascript Tag
Mobile SDK
Data Warehouse Integrations
Read on for details on each option. If you have questions about any of these options or would like to further explore an integration with a specific platform reach out to your Lytics contact.
Webhooks
Webhooks offer one of the simplest and most flexible options for enabling applications to share data. They’re broadly used in the cloud computing world",6,docs_lytics-integration-options.txt
lytics,Lytics Integration Options,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lytics-integration-options," for integrations that can be stood up quickly with a minimal amount of code. The Lytics Webhook integration supports triggered delivery of audience membership (enters and exits) to a destination url where another application can pick it up. See our Webhook documentation for full details.
Interested to understand how a Webhook integration might be applied? Look at this Mobile Messaging use case for a simple Lytics Webhook integration to support one-to-one personalized messaging with Twilio.
Server-to-Server File Transfer
Server-to-server file transfer is a very common mechanism for data sharing. Lytics File Service options enable Lytics to pull or push user data from an SFTP (secure file transfer protocol) using a CSV (comma-separated values) or JSON file. If you have another platform that also enables integrations via SFTP, this integration path helps to automate the process of passing data between your system and Lytics. Check out the Lytics File Service documentation

In addition to SFTP, Amazon S3 is a very commonly used medium for server-to-server file transfer. Refer to our Amazon S3 documentation
for data import and export options.
Javascript Layer/JS Tag
The Lytics JS Tag is the default option for client-side (website) data sharing with Lytics. The JS Tag supports the delivery of user behavior attributes from your website into Lytics and can also return back to the website user profile data such as audience members or content recommendations from Lytics for real time personalization. Refer to our JS Tag Documentation for full details.
Mobile SDK
The Lytics Mobile SDK facilitates in-app data sharing with iOS and Android. Similar to the JS Tag, the Mobile SDK supports user behavior-based data delivery to Lytics and profile data to the app for real-time personalization. See our Mobile SDK Documentation for more details.

Announcements about browsers changing their cookie tracking policies have created tremendous concern and confusion within marketing and advertising industries, and rightfully so. These changes represent dramatic shifts in how users and their activity are tracked across the web.
Browsers are removing third-party cookies and altering the default behavior of first-party cookies, which makes first-party data mission-critical for marketers more than ever before. The following explains how current and upcoming browser changes will impact your web tracking involving Lytics.
Overall impact
The blocking of third-party cookies, whether by browser default or user choice, will significantly impact the effectiveness, if not viability, of ad targeting, retargeting, attr",6,docs_impact-of-browser-tracking-changes.txt
lytics,Impact of Browser Tracking Changes,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/impact-of-browser-tracking-changes,"ibution, and measurement efforts dependent on the use of third-party cookies. In addition, Apple’s ITP 2.2 impacts certain marketing use cases.
For Safari users, cookies get cleared after seven days if there is no activity. So if a user visits a site once and returns eight days later, their cookie will be gone. However, if that user returns every day for eight days, their cookie will remain intact.
This can skew analytics, impact personalization efforts for anonymous users, and affect conversion attribution. But put it in perspective, while Safari accounts for over half of mobile web traffic in the US for non-mobile and worldwide browser usage, Safari’s market share is around 20 percent as of January 2020.
More importantly, these browser changes continue the trend of giving individuals more control over what brands/entities they want to engage with and transparency in that regard. They point to the need for brands to maximize relevant content or offerings for a site visitor in real-tim",7,docs_impact-of-browser-tracking-changes.txt
lytics,Impact of Browser Tracking Changes,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/impact-of-browser-tracking-changes,"e, which can lead to registration or other means of establishing a known, first-party relationship. These browser changes reflect the change from a model that exploits third-party data outside an established relationship to transparently establishing and cultivating a relationship with the consumer for mutual benefit.
Impact on Lytics
The good news is Lytics was designed to help companies establish first-party relationships with their customers and implement intelligent identity resolution strategies. Lytics enables you to collect and leverage first-party data in various ways, such as: acquiring new customers, serving ads on-site with highly targeted audiences, and promoting relevant content to users based on their interests.
Onto the technical details. To understand how these browser changes will impact the Lytics JavaScript tag (aka Tracking Tag) you must first understand the core mechanics of how Lytics builds profiles for your anonymous visitors.
It all begins with Lytics’ unique c",8,docs_impact-of-browser-tracking-changes.txt
lytics,Impact of Browser Tracking Changes,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/impact-of-browser-tracking-changes,"lient-side identifier, which is referred to as the UID or _uid. When a user visits your web property for the first time, the Lytics tag generates a unique value for this UID and stores it as a browser cookie. This UID is then appended to any behavioral data collected from their visit. Typically when a user returns after a subsequent visit, this UID persists since it has been stored as a cookie.
The impact of cookie changes on this process will vary by browser. In the case of Safari, for example, it means that if a user does not return within seven days, that particular identifier will be deleted. As such, it will become imperative to double down on your identity resolution strategies and ensure that efforts are being made to associate first-party anonymous cookies with other known identifiers that can persist, such as user IDs upon login.
In addition, some customers leverage the loadid parameter as part of their tag configuration. Historically, this has enabled a simple method for reso",9,docs_impact-of-browser-tracking-changes.txt
lytics,Impact of Browser Tracking Changes,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/impact-of-browser-tracking-changes,"lving identities across web properties. This loadid method relies on third-party cookies, which are impacted heavily by these cookie changes. Like the first-party implications above, cross-domain identity resolution strategies become more important.
To date, efforts have been made to rely less on browser cookies, given their uncertain nature. Version 3 of the Lytics JavaScript tag was built to be more secure and flexible**, allowing Lytics to respond to these types of changes more efficiently. At the end of the day, however, restricting or removing cookies, in general, will affect the way that you, the marketer, use and monitor the web. Focusing on safe, secure, and transparent resolution strategies is at the core of the Lytics platform, and we believe will allow any marketer to overcome these changes in the future.
Q. What cookies are issued in connection with the Lytics tag?
By default, Lytics sets a cookie seerid that is used to identify a user. This is then surfaced in a users prof",10,docs_impact-of-browser-tracking-changes.txt
lytics,Impact of Browser Tracking Changes,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/impact-of-browser-tracking-changes,"ile as _uid. Out of the box, this is what our JavaScript tag uses for web-based identity resolution.
Q. Are Lytics’ cookies first-party cookies or third-party cookies?
When issued by the client website domain on which they run, Lytics’ cookies are treated by browsers as first-party cookies. This is the case for all of our clients. In some cases, clients have established separate top-level domains for two or more of their brands. In these cases, many have leveraged an optional identity resolution aid that allows Lytics to store the same identifier as a third-party cookie. This allows for a hands-off approach to resolve identities across domains but in no way impacts the nature of our first-party cookies described above.
Stale cookie removal feature
Lytics has enabled a “cookie culling” feature that prevents “stale” (old) cookies from being used as identifiers to stitch the user profile fragments. Given the browser cookie limits mentioned above, this ensures only valid identifiers will b",11,docs_impact-of-browser-tracking-changes.txt
lytics,Impact of Browser Tracking Changes,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/impact-of-browser-tracking-changes,"e used to build your Lytics user profiles, which helps keep them clean and consolidated.
For example, if a Safari user visits your site once and doesn’t return within two months, Lytics can remove this cookie from their first visit as it has become “stale.” There is no reason to keep this cookie as an identifier because it can’t be used for personalization. Lytics recommends opting for a maximum of 60 days to keep cookies, but this setting can be customized according to your needs. Don't hesitate to contact your Lytics Account Manager if you are interested in enabling this cookie-culling feature.
Once Lytics removes cookies after your specified time frame, not only the “stale” cookies are removed, but any other profile fragments attached to those cookies will be omitted from the stitching process. As a result, any associated data with the old cookies will not be included on user profiles unless that data can be matched to some other identifier (e.g., an email or user ID). However, the ",12,docs_impact-of-browser-tracking-changes.txt
lytics,Impact of Browser Tracking Changes,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/impact-of-browser-tracking-changes,"data lost from turning on cookie culling can be found again if the feature is turned off or if the time range is shortened so that the cookie associated with the missing data is no longer skipped.
Cookie changes per browser
The following information has been updated as of January 31, 2020.
Cookies are used for persistent login, preference storage, and tracking across websites. Google, Apple, and other browser providers have deployed functionality that can block the tracking of users across websites. This functionality is promoted as privacy-enhancing by giving a user greater control to prevent website tracking. The technology generally focuses on third-party cookies, but Apple’s technology also focuses on certain first-party cookies.
Apple
Apple introduced its Intelligent Tracking Protection (ITP) functionality in 2017 to block the use of cookies deployed on sites not belonging to the party issuing the cookie. You can track Safari ITP changes on Apple’s WebKit website. Generally, Safar",13,docs_impact-of-browser-tracking-changes.txt
lytics,Impact of Browser Tracking Changes,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/impact-of-browser-tracking-changes,"i has set a 7-day expiration period on first-party cookies but a shorter 1-day setting on certain cookies used with link decoration. This means for users that don’t revisit a site within seven days to extend their expiration, the cookie will be deleted, and these users will get new identifiers the next time they visit the site.
Firefox
Like Safari, Firefox blocks third-party cookies by default through Enhanced Tracking Protection.
Google
In 2019 Google announced it was changing its approach to third-party cookies by not blocking them by default and recommending cookie developers use SameSite attributes. Chrome gives users options to block the cookies they want to block and to delete cookies after a session (fingerprinting out as well).
In mid-January of 2020, Google announced its intent to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome by 2022.Updated over 1 year ago Table of Contents

You can import existing marketing initiatives currently managed by your channel providers, which enables you to quickly gain insights about the campaigns you’re already running. You can then take action by connecting these Experiences to your Lytics audiences.
While you can monitor Experiences and activate audiences for them within Lytics, the management of external Experiences still happens inside your channel tools. If you want to stop, delete, or edit the execution of an Experience, you need to do so within the provider. If you choose to delete an Experience in Lytics that still has a matching campaign in your channel tool, it will show up on the import list and can be re-imported.
Centralize cross-channel reporting
Lytics serves as a central hub to monitor your cross-",6,docs_importing-external-experiences.txt
lytics,Importing External Experiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/importing-external-experiences,"channel marketing, making it easier to understand and improve the performance of
your campaigns. For example, instead of logging into Facebook to check your ad campaign metrics and Iterable to check your email newsletter open rates, you can monitor the performance of both tools within your Lytics dashboard.
To start monitoring external Experiences on Lytics, follow the batch import steps.
Monitor Experiences via batch import
On your Lytics dashboard, navigate to Experiences, and select Add Experiences > Import.
Select your provider
The Lytics Canvas connects out-of-the-box with select channel providers. Over time, more providers will be added to this list. If you want to use a provider that is not currently available, you can use the ""Generic Experience"" workflow to export Lytics audiences to any of your integrated providers.
Authorize
Next, you will be prompted to select an authorization for your chosen provider. Existing authorizations will be shown. If you have multiple accounts wit",7,docs_importing-external-experiences.txt
lytics,Importing External Experiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/importing-external-experiences,"hin a particular channel such as Facebook, you will choose which account to import from. If you don’t have an authorization, you will be prompted to add one before continuing. For Facebook, there is a second step for authorizing Ad Set ID after you’ve selected your account ID.
Import Experiences
Finally, select the Experiences you want to import into Lytics (up to 10 at a time). The total number of Experiences you can bring into Lytics is only limited by the amount in your connected provider. However, to have meaningful and accurate reporting, it's recommended to only import Experiences that will add value to your use cases.
Completed experiences, such as an Ad Set that previously ""ended"", will not show on the list of importable Experiences. But if you have Ad Sets in Facebook that are saved as drafts, paused, or currently running, those will be available to import.
Connect Experiences with Lytics audiences
Once you start monitoring external Experiences, you can activate them by adding",8,docs_importing-external-experiences.txt
lytics,Importing External Experiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/importing-external-experiences," a Lytics audience. This lets you enrich your existing campaigns with Lytics behavioral audiences, content affinities, and delivery optimization.
An example use case is to conserve Facebook ad spend by only targeting “Currently Engaged” users who have a high affinity for the content of a particular campaign. Leveraging data science under the hood, Lytics audiences can bring immediate value to your existing marketing campaigns.
If you have already imported an external Experience, you can activate it from the Experience summary view by clicking Edit in the top right.
If you want to activate an Experience that you haven't imported yet, follow the single import steps below, which will guide you through the Experience editor.
Activate Experiences via single import
To activate an Experience that you haven't imported yet, you will follow the workflow of creating a new Experience in Lytics. From the Experiences list view, click Add Experiences > New.

lytics,Importing External Experiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/importing-external-experiences," the campaign, ad set, or journey. This example will continue with importing a SendGrid campaign.
Next you will select an Authorization for your chosen provider as described above.
Then you will select the campaign or ad set to import. Note that here you can only import one Experience at a time. Click Import 1 Experience to continue.
Complete the Experience Editor steps
Finally, you will complete the following Experience Editor steps:
Target: configure your target audience for this Experience.
Configure provider: choose how the audience for your Experience will be exported to the third-party tool.
Configure delivery: option to automatically determine when to deliver messages to individual users on the third-party tool.
Upon completion, your Experience will be ready to publish.

Template Examples
Simple webhook payloads
One of the primary use-cases for templates is for shaping the request payload for outgoing Webhook Exports from Lytics. For example, say you are exporting a Lytics audience called frequent_visitors to a service that expects the following JSON in the request body:
JSON{
""first_name"": ""Bob"",
""last_name"": ""Smith"",
""email_address"": ""[email protected]"",
""marketing_list"": ""frequent_visitors""
}
We could create the following template in Lytics, and select it in our Webhook Export job configuration to send the correct request, using the first_name, last_name, and email fields on your Lytics profiles (see here for details on using the lytemplates.libsonnet library):
local event = (import 'lytemplates.libsonnet');
{
first_name: event.get(""first_name"", """")
last_name:
event.get(""last_name"", """"),
email_address: event.get(""email"", """"),
marketing_list: even",9,docs_api-created-templates.txt
lytics,Creating Templates using Lytics API,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/api-created-templates,"t.segSlug()
}
Once created, this template can be selected from the Lytics Template dropdown menu in the webhook job configuration.
Using assert to skip events that have empty required fields
Many times when sending webhook events, certain fields must be set or the webhook endpoint will respond with an HTTP error, causing the webhook job to fail.
This simple template uses the Jsonnet assert function to signal that email must be set before sending. These events will be omitted from sending and will be logged with the included assertion message email must be set.
JSONlocal event = (import ""lytemplates.libsonnet"");
local email() =
local email = event.get(""email"", """");
assert email != """" : 'email must be set';
email;
{
""email"": email()
}
Using templates for dynamic URLs
You can also use a template to dynamically generate URLs for webhook requests instead of hard-coding one in your job configuration. Say you are exporting Lytics profiles to a service that expects requests to the following en",10,docs_api-created-templates.txt
lytics,Creating Templates using Lytics API,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/api-created-templates,"dpoint where {email} is the user's email address:
https://test.com/users/{email}/subscribe
We could create the following template, which extracts the email from each Lytics profile and includes it in the URL:
local event = (import 'lytemplates.libsonnet');
'https://www.test.com/users/' + event.get(""email"", """") + '/subscribe'
Once created, this template can be selected from the Webhook URL dropdown menu in the webhook job configuration.Updated 2 months ago Table of Contents

Monitoring and alerting is available on every job and every authorization within Lytics.
To set up alerting on your jobs or authorizations, you can set up a monitoring job from either the Job API or the Lytics UI for alerting to Slack, Microsoft Teams, or directly to email.
If a source or destination job has failed, Lytics will show the latest error message on the Conductor Diagnostics Dashboard and on the Logs tab of the Source/Destination Job Summary interface, and allow the job to be restarted if needed. The most detailed information for troubleshooting can be accessed from the Job Logs API

lytics,Authorizations,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/keys-authorizations,"ge CampaignRecommend Content CampaignCampaign ReportingCampaign ManagementBuilding Audiences with Campaign DataAuthorizations Suggest EditsWhat are Authorizations?
Channel tool authorizations refer to the permissions granted to various integrations that allow our platform to access and use data from third-party channels. These integrations can include email service providers, social media platforms, and advertising networks.
Once permission has been granted, Lytics surfaces ""Authorizations,"" which allow you to manage and maintain the connection to your channel tools over time. This document outlines how to create and manage auths to ensure the long-term health of your data pipeline.
Creating Authorizations
Authorizations are currently accessed from your account navigation menu by selecting Account > Security > Authorizations.
Within the Authorizations section of the interface, you will see a list of existing Authorizations and a button to ""+ Create New,"" clicking this button will take ",6,docs_keys-authorizations.txt
lytics,Authorizations,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/keys-authorizations,"you to the Authorization wizard, where you will:
Choose the provider.
Select the desired authorization method.
Add a name (label), description, and complete the configuration options.
You will need authorization for most jobs when going through the job creation wizard in Lytics. At the ""Choose Authorization"" step, you can opt to create a new authorization which will direct you to the authorizations wizard in a new tab. You will be prompted to choose the method and configure the authorization before configuring your job.
Authorization Methods
Note that some integration providers only have one authorization method, but others offer multiple methods such as API keys, OAuth, etc. Specific methods may enable different jobs, such as real-time vs. bulk audience exports. If you are unsure which method to use, you can find more information in your provider's integration documentation.
For example, if you are looking to import event data from Google Cloud Pub/Sub into Lytics, there is only one m",7,docs_keys-authorizations.txt
lytics,Authorizations,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/keys-authorizations,"ethod from the list of Google Cloud authorization methods that supports the Import Data (Cloud Pub/Sub) job in Lytics.
Managing Authorizations
The Authorization Summary provides essential details about each authorization to help ensure an integration is appropriately set up to enable data to flow in and out of Lytics. At the top of the summary page, you’ll see the following information:
Provider: The third-party tool that this authorization connects to.
Method: Indicates how the authorization was made, such as API keys, OAuth, personal or business users, etc.
Health: Indicates whether the Authorization is valid and active.
Owner: Lytics user who created the authorization.
Created At: The date the authorization was initially created.
Last Updated: The date the authorization was most recently edited.
What determines authorization health?
Lytics checks the status of authorizations daily to help you proactively resolve authorization issues. Our API will return one of three possible statuse",8,docs_keys-authorizations.txt
lytics,Authorizations,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/keys-authorizations,"s, depending on the data available for your provider:
Healthy: The authorization is valid and active.
Unhealthy: The authorization is invalid and inactive.
Unknown: The authorization status is unknown.
If your authorization is marked ""Unhealthy,"" Lytics cannot verify that it has the requisite access and permissions. Visit the Authorization page for your provider and confirm that the authorization credentials you entered have the necessary permissions in the external tool.
If adjusting permissions in the external tool does not apply or is not an option, you may need to create a new authorization to use with your jobs in Lytics. You can optionally delete the unhealthy authorization.
Edit or Delete Authorizations
You can edit or delete authorizations directly in the Lytics UI using the buttons at the top right of each authorization summary page. The edit option allows you to rename the authorization and revise the description, but the configuration options cannot be changed. If you need a",9,docs_keys-authorizations.txt
lytics,Authorizations,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/keys-authorizations," different configuration, you must create a new Authorization, and you can delete the previous one.
🚧You can only delete an authorization if no active jobs use it. If there are associated jobs with a running, sleeping, or paused status, you must delete those associated jobs before deleting the authorization. Likewise, you will need to delete any imported Experiences that are actively using an authorization before deleting that authorization.
Activity Metrics
Once metrics are available for each authorization, this chart will become populated with the number of requests made using the authorization. You can adjust the date window and toggle to view the metrics hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the available data.
📘Authorization metrics are currently only available for select providers (including Facebook, Iterable, Salesforce, SendGrid, and others), but metrics support is being added for all providers.
Associated Jobs

Authorizing the connection between Lytics and other providers allows you to create jobs to import, export, and enrich your first-party data.
Navigate to Account > Security > Authorizations to find your Authorizations Dashboard, which gives an overview of all authorizations in your account and their usage.
All authorizations are displayed in a table and are sortable by the following fields:
Label: The name of the authorization as defined by your input for the ""label"" field.

lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping," CampaignPresent a Message CampaignRecommend Content CampaignCampaign ReportingCampaign ManagementBuilding Audiences with Campaign DataAdvanced Mapping Functions Suggest EditsLytics Conductor supports numerous built-in functions for light data transformation and logic evaluation to allow users to map only data that is relevant to their customer profile and format it the way they need for activation of their use cases.
📘For more complex data transformation and aggregation we suggest utilizing Cloud Connect (with or without Lytics Warehouse) for bringing in calculated attributes.
Expressions
Mapping Keys vs. Literals
To map the data value passed in an event you will want to use the associated key within the Expression. When creating mappings it is important to remember that keys need to be wrapped in single backticks (``).
Literals (which can be a string, int, float, bool, or timestamp) are used to map a static value to the field. These are often used with conditionals.
Conditions
Condit",6,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping,"ions allow you perform logical evaluations to determine when to store a value on a field based on any of the data passed within the same incoming event.
Merge Operators Merge operators allow you to determine how a value will be written to a field in relation to the currently stored value.
Data Types Kind = ""int"" | ""number"" | ""string"" | ""date"" | ""[]string"" |
""ts[]string"" | ""map[string]int"" | ""map[string]number"" | ""map[string]string*
Screenshot Example of supplying expression / condition to a mapping
This example showcases the default mapping for the mo_email_unsub field from the Marketo Activity import.
Here we see we are writing count over time in which we see activityTypeId as a key in the incoming event data.
However, we are only writing this expressions results when that incoming event data evaluates the condition eq(activityTypeId, ""9"") as true.
String Functions
These functions are used to manipulate string fields.
join
Join together multiple values, coerce them into strings. Last ",7,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping,"argument is which string to use to join (may be empty string).
join Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""street"":""698 Candlewood Lane"",
""city"":""Cabot Cove"",
""state"":""ME"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuejoin(`street`,`city`,`state`,"", "")
698 Candlewood Lane, Cabot Cove, ME
Breaking down the Example
The join() function takes at minimum 2 arguments (utilizing the LAST argument as the ""joining"" string), and concatenates each argument in order utilizing the ""joining"" string.
In this example we produce a single string consisting of street, city, state values concatenated utilizing the ""joining"" string ,
(comma followed by a space).
len
Length (of array, string) find the length of a string, return integer value of length.
len Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""_e"":""item_added_to_cart"",
""items_in_cart"": [
""ISBN_9780553119978"",
""ISBN_9780345324481""
],
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuelen(`items_in_cart`)
2
Breaking down the Example
The l",8,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping,"en() function here is operating on a field whose value is an array, so the output is the number of items in the array. Applying len() to a string results in the character length of the string.
oneof
Choose value from the first field that has a non nil (empty string """"inclusive) value.
oneof Example
Example Event Data (JSON)
{
""account_id"":""000-000-001"",
""account_name"":""Planet Express"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valueoneof(`account_no`,`account_id`)
000-000-001
Breaking down the Example
This oneof() function first checks and sees that the account_no field does not exist in the event data, so then moves to the account_id which is found to be a non nil value and is returned.
replace
Converts the value to a string and then replaces the matching part of a string with another string. If no replacement string is passed or an empty string is passed the matched string is simply removed.
replace Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""_e"":""search"",
""url"":""https://pawnee",9,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping,"indiana.com/parks-and-recreation"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuereplace( replace( path(`url`),""/""),""-"", "" "")
parks and recreation
Breaking down the Example
Using path finds the path of the url which is ""/parks-and-recreation"".
The inner replace finds all parts of the string that matches ""/"" and since there is no specified string replacement ""/"" is replaced with nothing. This results in a value of ""parks-and-recreation""
The outer replace() takes the resulting ""parks-and-recreation"" and finds all of the parts of the string that matches ""-"" and replaces with a space ("" ""). Leading to the final value of ""parks and recreation""
split
Breaks a variable into smaller fragments given a specific delimiter
split Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""_e"":""preferences-set"",
""favorite-genres"":""mystery|science fiction|fantasy"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valueset( split(`favorite-genres`, ""|""))
[
""fantasy"",
""mystery"",
""science fiction""
]
Break",10,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping,"ing down the Example
The split() splits the incoming value associated with the favorite-genres key at each of the ""|"" characters the value contains.
Because split() will split the value into fragments that are stored as an array, you will need to map it to a field that is a set data type ([]string or []time) and you will also want to wrap set() (for strings) or totimeset() (for datetimes) around the function.
The order of a set of strings resulting from the split function will be alphabetical. The order of a set of datetimes resulting from the split function will be oldest to latest. However, if you use an array.index function to pull out a value based on position, the originally passed order will be referenced.
strip
Strip removes leading and trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, newline, carriage-return) from strings, or arrays of strings.
strip Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""_e"":""preferences-set"",
""favorite-sub-genres"":""detective fiction | cozy mystery | space opera | steampunk"",
",11,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping,"""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuestrip( split(`favorite-sub-genres`, ""|""))
[
""detective fiction"",
""cozy mystery"",
""space opera"",
""steampunk""
]
Breaking down the Example
The split() function splits the incoming value associated with the favorite-sub-genres key at each of the ""|"" characters the value contain. In this example it will create 4 strings that are stored in an array output alphabetical order.
The strip() function then removes the leading and trailing spaces around each of the strings within the array.
string.lowercase
Convert strings to lower case
string.lowercase Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""_e"":""registration"",
""vehical_make"":""DMC"",
""vehical_model"":""DeLorean"",
""plate_number"":""outatime"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuestring.lowercase(`vehical_make`)
dmc
Breaking down the Example
The string.lowercase() function looks at each character in the string value and converts to the lowercase equivalent.
string.uppercase
",12,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping,"Convert strings to upper case
string.uppercase Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""_e"":""registration"",

""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuestring.uppercase(`plate_number`)
OUTATIME
Breaking down the Example
The string.uppercase() function looks at each character in the string value and converts to the uppercase equivalent.
string.titlecase
Convert strings to title case
string.titlecase Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""_e"":""profile-completed"",
""full_name"":""ARTHUR DENT"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuestring.titlecase( string.lowercase(`full_name`))
Arthur Dent
📘Using string.titlecase() only operates on the first character of each ""word"" in the string, and thus will always require that you first convert the string to lowercase using string.lowercase()for the full traditional titlecase conversion.
Breaking down the Example
Using the string.lowercase() will",13,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping," first normalize the incoming string by converting it to lowercase.
Wrapping the string.titlecase() will then convert the string into title case.
string.index
Find position of substring within a string, return ordinal starting position.
string.index Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""numberString"":""0123456789"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuestring.index(`numberString`, ""1"")
1
Breaking down the Example
string.index() utilizes a '0' based index, so the first character in the string is at index 0, and the ""1"" being the second character in the string is at index 1
string.substr
Extract a string from a string using positional start/end.
string.substr Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""numberString"":""0123456789"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""

Casting & Conversion
These functions allow you to cast and convert data into different types.
note: for todate
conversion, see the Date / Time section below.
toint
Converts strings to integers. Useful for converting a string to a number before applying a number-based expression
toint Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""stringOne"":""1.7"",
""stringTwo"":""2"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuesum(toint(`stringOne`), toint(`stringTwo`))
3
Breaking down the Example
Here we have a summation function applying to the result of converting two different string fields to int(s) and wrapping them in the sum() function. We first convert the value for stringOne = ""1.7"" into it's int equivalent 1, then convert the value for strin",19,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping,"gTwo = ""2"" into it's int equivalent 2... then the summation result of the two int values is 3
tonumber
Converts string to numbers. Useful for converting a string to a number while needing to keep decimal precision
tonumber Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""stringOne"":""1.7"",
""stringTwo"":""2"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuesum(tonumber(`stringOne`), tonumber(`stringTwo`))
3.7
Breaking down the Example
Here we have a summation function applying to the result of converting two different string fields to number(s) and wrapping them in the sum() function. We first convert the value for stringOne = ""1.7"" into it's number equivalent 1.7 (keeping decimal precision), then convert the value for stringTwo = ""2"" into it's number equivalent 2... then the summation result of the two number values is 3.7
tobool
Casts to boolean:
Numeric Values of 0/1 convert to false/true respectively
String Values will convert as:
""0"", ""f"", ""F"", ""false"", ""FALSE"", ""False"" -> false
""1"", ",20,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping,"""t"", ""T"", ""true"", ""TRUE"", ""True"" -> true
tobool Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""boolField"":""F"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuetobool(`boolField`)
false
Map & Set/Array Functions
These functions manipulate map or set fields.
note: for the len function see the String function listed above
filter
Filter out values that match the specified criteria
filter Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""sliceField"":""red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuefilter(strip(split(`sliceField`, "","")), ""bl*"")
[
""red"",
""orange"",
""yellow"",
""green"",
""indigo"",
""violet""
]
Breaking Down the Example
This filter() operates on top of the array built by split()'ing and strip()'ing the sliceField.
Once we have our base array, we then apply the filter ""bl*"" (in which * is a wildcard) to match the ""blue"" value and filter it OUT of the array (returning an array including all the unmatched values)
map
Create an object/m",21,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping,"ap of key-value pairs.
Often used to keep map of key (event-name?) to value
(last occurrence date?).
Or other user level key-value pair data.
map Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""listName"":""Pretend Campaign"",
""subscribeStatus"":""subscribed"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuemap(`listName`, `subscribeStatus`)
{
""Pretend Campaign"": ""subscribed""
}
match
Match a key, and then keep a map of key/values with the match value removed.
match Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""example_a"":1,
""example_b"":2,
""example_c"":3,
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuematch(""example_"")
{
""a"": ""1"",
""b"": ""2"",
""c"": ""3""
}
Breaking Down the Example
The match() function here looks for all keys prefixed with ""example_"", and finding 3 results, creates a map of key (key suffix) -> value pairs from those results utilizing the suffix of the original keys
to write to the map.
mapkeys
Given a map, return a list of strings consisting of the keys from the map
mapkeys E",22,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping,"xample
Example Event Data (JSON){
""example_a"":1,
""example_b"":2,
""example_c"":3,
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuemapkeys(match(""example_""))
[
""b"",
""c"",
""a""
]
Breaking Down the Example
The mapkeys() function here utilizing the result of the match() statement as it's input map, and returns a list consisting of the keys from that map.
mapvalues
Given a map, return a list of the values (as strings)
mapvalues Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""example_a"":1,
""example_b"":2,
""example_c"":3,
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuemapvalues(match(""example_""))
[
""3"",
""1"",
""2""
]
Breaking Down the Example
The mapvalues() function here utilizes the result of the match() statement as it's input map, and returns a string list consisting of the values from that map.
mapinvert
Given a map, return a map of type map[string]string, inverting the keys/values from the initial map
Example Event Data (JSON){
""example_a"":1,
""example_b"":2,
""example_c"":3,
""_uid"":""0",23,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping,"123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuemapinvert(match(""example_""))
{
""1"": ""a"",
""2"": ""b"",
""3"": ""c""
}
Breaking Down the Example
The mapinvert() function here utilizes the result of the match() statement as it's input map, and returns a map (map[string]string) with each key-> value pair inverted (value->key).
array.index
Cherry pick a single item out of an array
array.index Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""fruits"": [""apples"", ""oranges"", ""peaches""],
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuearray.index(`fruits`, 0)
apples
Breaking Down the Example
The array.index() function utilizes a 0 indexed array to cherry pick the requested indexes value, in this case 0 being the first indexed item returns ""apples"".
array.slice
Slice an array of items selecting some subset of them
array.slice Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""fruits"": [""tomato"", ""apple"", ""orange"", ""peach""],
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valuearray.slice(`fruits`, 1, 4)
[
",24,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping,"""apple"",
""orange"",
""peach""
]
Breaking Down the Example
For this example the array.slice() function takes 3 parameters (the 3rd being optional), and returns an array consisting of the subset of the initial array (1st parameter) beginning at the start index (2nd parameter) up to, but not including, the end index (3rd parameter, if not provided then it defaults to the end of the input array). Reminder that these functions utilize 0 indexed arrays, so the index of 1 is actually the 2nd item in the array.
URL/HTTP & Email Functions
These functions manipulate strings which are URLs or email addresses.
email
Extract email address from ""Bob <[email protected]>"" format, note that the extracted email addresses are converted to lowercase and checked to ensure the existence of @ symbol as well.
email Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""email"":""Test <[email protected]>"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valueemail(`email`)
[email protected]
Breaking Down the Example
In this e",25,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping,"xample the email() function first extracts the email address of ""[email protected]"" from the input (this input can be in the the simplified input already, and will then just apply the second part of the function). Once we have the email address, the function then performs a lowercase operation and checks to ensure the presence of an @ symbol. This check is fairly rudimentary and may change to provide stricter validation in the future.
emailname
Extract Bob from Bob <[email protected]>
emailname Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""email"":""Test <[email protected]>"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""

}
ExpressionResulting Valueurlmain(`_url`)
subdomain.domain.tld/path/extended_path
Breaking Down the Example
The urlmain() function here strips the leading scheme (""https://"") and query string parameters (""?qsparam=p1&qsp2=param2"") from the provided url.
domain
Extract domain from URL
domain Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""_url"": ""https://subdomain.domain.tld/path/extended_path?qsparam=p1&qsp2=param2"",

""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valueurldecode(qs(`_url`, ""spaced""))
this is spaced
Breaking Down the Example
With this example of urldecode() we want to decode the ""spaced"" query parameter value.
To do this we first extract the parameters' value utilizing the qs() function, returning ""this%20is%20spaced"".
We then proceed to use the urldecode() func",28,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping,"tion to convert the ""%20"" to "" "", and have our decoded string of ""this is spaced"".
urlminusqs

""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""
}
ExpressionResulting Valueqs(`_url`, ""qsp2""))
param2
Breaking Down the Example
Here the qs() function attempts to find the requested query string parameter in the URL and returns it if found.
It's important to note here that this function inherently lowercases the URL provided BEFORE attempting to match the query string, where qs2()
will search the raw URL provided",29,docs_advanced-mapping.txt
lytics,Advanced Mapping Functions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/advanced-mapping," without lowercasing.
Effectively qs(url, param) == qs2(tolower(url), param)
qs2
Extract a querystring parameter without lowercasing the URL before checking for the parameter
qs2 Example
Example Event Data (JSON){
""_url"": ""https://subdomain.domain.tld/path/extended_path?qsParam=p1&qsp2=param2"",
""_uid"":""0123-4567-8901-2345-6789""

Introduction
LQL (Lytics Query Language) is a proprietary query language developed by Lytics that allows users to cleanse, filter, and define the relationship between independent sources of data to materialize a unified consumer profile. This document outlines how to review, maintain, and create complex LQL queries.
📘With the introduction of Conductor all core data mapping functionality is now available directly in the UI. LQL is still available via API for technical users looking to automate process or manage fields an mappings in bulk but the vast majority of day-to-day users may benefit from diving deeper into Conductor.
Exploring LQL Queries
The Browse Queries section in Lytics lets you see the Lytics ",6,docs_lytics-query-language.txt
lytics,Queries & LQL,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lytics-query-language,"Query Language (LQL) used in your account. To view this on your Lytics dashboard, navigate to Data > Queries. From there, you can click on any item in the table to view an individual LQL file.
This is useful if you need to find out the exact definition of a specific user field and cannot access your LQL directly. Remember that you can't edit or remove LQL from the Lytics UI. For a more detailed breakdown of LQL and how it works, see the full article on Queries & LQL.
Managing LQL Queries
The Lytics Query Language (LQL) is used to define the transformation of uploaded records and event data into user fields on a customer profile. It transforms row-level event data into document-oriented user info. This Query language is similar to the HIVE or SQL query languages. However, it departs from these to offer more of a Rich Document (JSON user profile) construction. The following section will explain how to write, validate, and upload queries using LQL.

Query Management
Once you have written your LQL file, you can save it with the .lql extension. And use the following request to validate the query using the Lytics API.
curl -s -XPOST ""https://api.lytics.io/api/query/_validate"" \
-H ""Authorization: $LIOKEY"" \
-H ""Content-Type: text/plain"" \
--data-binary @/tmp/tmp.lql | jq '.'
You can upload your query to your account if it is valid..
curl -s -XPOST ""https://api.lytics.io/api/query"" \
-H ""Authorization: $LIOKEY"" \
-H ""Content-Type: text/plain"" \
--data-binary @your_file.lql | jq '.'
To look at the user schema generated from the LQL:
curl -s -H ""Authorization: $LIOKEY"" ",9,docs_lytics-query-language.txt
lytics,Queries & LQL,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lytics-query-language,"\
-XGET ""https://api.lytics.io/api/schema/user"" | jq '.'
Standard Syntax
There a few common keywords used in LQL syntax:
SELECT Select data to be added to user profiles, including Maps, Counts, and other complex data types.
FROM The stream to select from.
INTO This is USER for all user profiles.
(Technically you could create other types, such as ""account"".)
WHERE Filters out entire records to not be included/analyzed such as Bots, Employees, Test data.
BY What field are we going to identify this entity by.
ALIAS When a selection query has an alias, that is the profile-fragment(table) name to use.
Use the following reference for a full syntactical guide when writing your own LQL:
Select = ""SELECT"" COLUMNS FROM INTO BY [WHERE] ALIAS
# required from, the stream to operate on for this query
FROM = ""FROM"" Identifier
# Required Identified By field, name of column ""AS"" from Column
BY = ""BY"" Identifier [""OR"" Identifier]
# Required Alias for giving a query a unique identifier

Date & Time Functions
These functions manipulate date fields. Our core date parser recognizes about 50 date formats, so in general these will operate on any format.
If you are using EU dates, you will need to specify the parser format.
dayofweek Type: Integer.
0-6 integer of day of week.
Examples:
dayofweek() => 4
OR
dayofweek(mydatefield)
epochms Type: Integer.
Unix MS of the date stamp on the current message being processed
extract
Can be used to extract parts of date and time.
Example usage on the strftime site
extract(reg_date, ""%B"") Returns name of month
extract(reg_date, ""%d"") Returns day of month
hourofday Type: Integer.
Hour of day (in 24 hour utc time).
hourofday()
OR hourofday(field)
hourofweek 0-167 integer for hour of week
mm Type:
Integer.
0-11 month
(alias for monthofyear)
mm() => current month, 6 for june, mm(my_date_field)
monthofyear Type:
Integer
Output the 0-11 month value
now Type:

seconds Type: Integer.
Seconds, extracts things like seconds(""00:30"") => 30 and seconds(""10:30"") => 630
todate Converts strings to dates.
Datemath:
todate(""now-3m"")
Date math relative to message timestamp.
Parser:
todate(""02/01/2006"") More than 30 formats supported. Date Parser
Examples with 2 arguments: todate(date_field_format, date_field_name) where date_field_format represents how date_field_name should be parsed and uses golang's time package formatting
todate(""02/01/2006 15:04:05 PM"",date_field_name) outputs date_field_name as European format (where 01 is a placeholder for month, 02 is a placeholder for day, and 2006 is a placeholder for year, 15 is a placeholder for hour, 04 is a placeholder for minute, and 05 is a placeholder for second. If the timestamp is in AM/PM format, use PM. For 24Hr format, do not add am/pm after second field.)
for e.g., todate(""02/01/2006 15:04:05 PM"",""30/04/2014 12:25:30 PM"") parses the date ""30/04/2014 12:25:30 PM"" as Europe",23,docs_lytics-query-language.txt
lytics,Queries & LQL,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lytics-query-language,"an format. Please refer to golang's time package documentation for more information about date time formats.
todatein Converts strings to dates and parses the given datetime for the given location. For e.g., todatein(date_field_name, ""America/Los_Angeles"") parses the date_field_name for Los Angeles location. If no location info is provided in date string such as ""2017-09-30 17:00:00"" this will allow you to apply a timezone.
We still convert back to UTC for storage.
totimestamp Convert to Integer Unix Seconds (UTC).
yy Type: int
Date conversion to YY format, so May 1 2014 is expressed as 14.
yy(dob), or yy() for record time stamp
yymm
String The YYMM date format, so May 1 2014 is expressed as 1405.
yy(dob), or yy() for record time stamp
timebucket Creates a tabulation of timestamps which can be used to segment based on timewindows.
timebucket(now()) for collect time, or timebucket(todate(field)) to bucket on the value of a field

Lytics offers pre-built integrations for many of today’s most popular marketing tools to ease the onboarding and exporting of data. These integrations are available in the Data tab of the Lytics platform under Data > Jobs. Each of these marketing tools has specific instructions for setup found in our integrations documentation.
Types
The implementation type refers to the development methods used to implement the job. Usually this depends on the third-party provider's capabilities and the resources they provide to outside developers such as APIs or SDKs. Integrations may be client-side or server-side.
Client-side Integrations
Client-side integrations are implemented in browser-facing code. These are implemented through the Lytics JavaScript tag and usually require you to have a tag from the third-party provider also install",6,docs_integrated-marketing-tools.txt
lytics,Integration Patterns,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools,"ed on your web page. Given the nature of these integrations being tightly coupled to the browser session, these integrations collect and send data in real time. There are two types of client-side integrations:
Push Integrations
A push integration pushes data from Lytics, such as surfaced fields or audience membership of users to the third party. Examples of push integrations include personalization tools such as Pathfora SDK which uses Lytics user data to personalize the page with content based on audience membership, or data management platforms (DMPs) such as Krux, which transmits Lytics user information to the DMP.
Pull Integrations
A pull integration pulls data from the third party and imports it into Lytics. This data will differ based on the provider, and the exact fields available in the audience builder will be listed in the respective integration document. An example of this type of integration includes the Lytics JavaScript tag communicating with a data layer object on your w",7,docs_integrated-marketing-tools.txt
lytics,Integration Patterns,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools,"ebsite to collect data from various third-party vendors such as Tealium or even a custom implementation.
Server-to-server Integrations
Server-side integrations allow Lytics and the third-party service to communicate directly, usually in the form of a job. These jobs are available to set up and execute in the Lytics platform under Data > Jobs. There are two main types of Server-side integrations:
Import Integrations
As the name implies, import integrations ingest data into Lytics. This data will differ based on the provider and job type. It can be anything from identifying information, demographic data, subscription status, or activity data for a user. Examples of import integrations include the Amplitude Cohorts Import which imports user data from Amplitude.
Export Integrations
Export integrations send user profile data from Lytics to a third-party tool, usually at the audience level. You can select which audience(s) you want to export, and include user data such as user fields, audien",8,docs_integrated-marketing-tools.txt
lytics,Integration Patterns,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools,"ce membership and more such as the SendGrid User Export. However, some integrations may export raw event data or metrics for monitoring such as the BigQuery Event Export or the New Relic Insights Monitoring job.
Enrichment Integrations
An enrichment integration uses a third-party service to enhance and enrich existing user profiles within Lytics. These integrations require Lytics to push a list of user identifiers (defined by an audience of known users) to a third-party enrichment tool. That tool then returns additional data on that user such as information on the user's company (for B2B marketing), or additional demographic and social data. Examples of enrichment integrations include Full Contact Audience Enrichment and Clearbit User Enrichment jobs.
Many providers support both import and export job types for a complete two-way data sync between Lytics and the third-party tool.
Implementation Techniques
Client and server-side integrations may be implemented in a number of different wa",9,docs_integrated-marketing-tools.txt
lytics,Integration Patterns,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools,"ys. The implementation technique often determines factors such as Tier, Frequency, and Resulting Data.
Client-side Implementations
JavaScript Tag
All default client-side integrations somehow utilize the Lytics JavaScript tag. The tag implements functions for sending data to a data stream and receiving user profile data which has been surfaced. Behind the scenes, these functions utilize some of the public Lytics API endpoints.
Server-side Implementations
APIs
API integrations utilize REST or SOAP APIs the third-party vendor provides to send or receive data. The specific endpoints used are listed in the documentation for the integration. Lytics prefers to integrate with third parties via API as it provides a deeper out-of-the-box integration.
Audience Triggers
Audience triggers are used in conjunction with an API implementation for export or enrichment job types. Audience triggers are powered by an internal system called subscriptions. Subscriptions listen to specific events, such as whe",10,docs_integrated-marketing-tools.txt
lytics,Integration Patterns,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools,"n a user has entered or exited an audience. A subscription can then send a trigger to any job listening to the subscription. Once received, the job can push the updated user data to the third-party tool via APIs. This process enables real-time exports versus a scheduled batch export.
File-Based Transfer
Lytics supports file-based import and export jobs.
Files may be obtained or pushed to a server via Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). SFTP integrations may be provided for third-party vendors who do not have API capabilities or as part of a custom integration. Lytics has a managed SFTP server that can be used to transfer files, or it may retrieve files from a third-party SFTP server.
Another example of a file-based export is via Email Attachment, such as the CSV Email Export.
Webhooks
Many third-party vendors offer webhooks or API callbacks, which send requests containing relevant user-activity data to another service after an event has occurred in the system. The Lytics API has a co",11,docs_integrated-marketing-tools.txt
lytics,Integration Patterns,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools,"llection endpoint that can be used as a destination for third-party webhooks. Providers that support webhooks will have documentation detailing the preferred setup method for Lytics to receive webhook data.
In addition, Lytics supports webhooks that can be configured to send user-level events, such as real-time audience membership updates.
Frequency
Frequency describes when and how often that data is sent or received. It attempts to answer common questions such as: ""When will I see data in my tool?"" and ""Can I keep my data up-to-date?"" Lytics integrations are either real-time or scheduled.
Real-time
A number of different integration types are considered real-time (or ""near"" real-time). In that, user data is sent or received downstream as soon as the data is available in the native system. The following types of integrations are considered real-time:
Client-Side Integrations - All client-side integrations are considered real-time unless otherwise stated in the documentation. Data collec",12,docs_integrated-marketing-tools.txt
lytics,Integration Patterns,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools,"ted via a pull integration is captured in the browser while the user performs actions, and push integrations always contain the most up-to-date data from the user profile.
Webhooks - As stated above, webhooks are API calls that happen after an event has occurred, often used to notify downstream tools.
Jobs Using Triggers - As stated above, jobs utilizing triggers receive and may push events downstream in real-time. Depending on rate limits or other such limitations of the third-party in question, the job may queue a small batch of events over a short amount of time before sending them, hence ""near"" real-time.
Backfill
Jobs that use audience triggers also often have an option to perform a backfill of users. Without a backfill, only new users who enter the audience after the time of job setup will be processed. Enabling a one-time backfill as part of the job configuration will immediately process a batch of all existing users in the audience to the third-party tool and then rely on real-",13,docs_integrated-marketing-tools.txt
lytics,Integration Patterns,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools,"time triggers to update user information once the backfill is finished. Some jobs support this feature as a configurable option. If so, it is listed under the ""Frequency"" section of ""Integration Details"" in a job's documentation.
Batch
Batch integrations send or receive user data in larger batches. Depending on the configuration of the job, it may only import/export a single batch of users once, or it may run continuously, checking for new users and updates to existing user data.
One-time run - You may want to run a one-time job to import, export, or enrich users at a specific point in time. For example, if you're running a one-time promotional blast email to a unique audience, exporting your audience once before sending the email would make sense.
Continuous Update - Many batch jobs support a configuration option for continuous updates which will re-run the job on some cadence (hourly, daily, weekly, etc). This is common for import jobs for providers that don't support webhooks, as Ly",14,docs_integrated-marketing-tools.txt
lytics,Integration Patterns,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools,"tics will want to keep the user profiles up to date with what is available in the third party.
Scheduled - Some jobs may support specific scheduled run times, which can be especially helpful for continuous updates. It allows you to specify the time of day the job should run and the timezone.
Resulting Data
The final way Lytics categorizes integrations is by the type of data it handles and how the job output is perceived. The resulting export and push integration data will vary based on the structures supported by the provider tool, and each integration will document the specific output type. Here is a list of common data types in Lytics for import and pull integrations:
User Profiles
When you import users, you will likely see new user profiles created for users that previously did not have data associated with them in Lytics. However, you may also see updates to existing users' profiles, if Lytics is able to recognize an existing user based on the identity resolution strategy for your ",15,docs_integrated-marketing-tools.txt
lytics,Integration Patterns,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools,"account.
User Fields
The new user fields that are created as part of an integration are listed in the ""Fields"" section of each doc. These fields will be added to new and existing user profiles as described in the section above, and they will become available for segmentation in the audience builder.
Raw Event Data
If data is imported to Lytics without being mapped by LQL, this data is stored as raw fields in data streams, which are un-actionable. For example, if you are importing custom data via CSV, you will need queries in place for the raw data to be meaningful. In addition, some pre-built integrations may import additional fields that are not mapped as part of the default queries provided by the out-of-the-box integration. You may contact support for assistance with mapping these fields.
Content
In addition to user data, some integrations may ingest content that can be analyzed and processed by the Lytics Content Affinity Engine. An example of this is the MailChimp Import which, in",16,docs_integrated-marketing-tools.txt
lytics,Integration Patterns,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools," addition to user data, brings in content from your MailChimp email campaigns. This content can help inform affinity scores for users who have viewed and interacted with the email.
Metrics
This is an uncommon pattern in existing integrations, but Lytics can also import specific metrics from third-party tools. For example, in the Goal Canvas, Facebook Experience metrics are imported directly from the Facebook Insights API. Metrics that are imported to Lytics are accessible via the Metrics API.
PGP Encryption
File imports and exports can be decrypted and encrypted, respectively using
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). To create or ingest PGP encrypted files, use an authorization that includes PGP keys.
PGP Public Key authorizations are used to encrypt exports.
PGP Private Key authorizations are used to decrypt imports.
Follow the instructions below when creating a PGP authorization.
PGP Public Key
Use a PGP Public Key authorization to encrypt file exports. You will need to generate an armored PG",17,docs_integrated-marketing-tools.txt
lytics,Integration Patterns,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools,"P key pair if you haven't already.
In the PGP Public Key field, enter your public key. Be sure to include the header and footer of the armored key. This means your entry should begin and end with the following:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- and -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
If your key does not begin and end with these strings respectively, it is possible it has not been ASCII armored.
PGP Private Key
Use a PGP Private Key authorization to decrypt file imports. You will need the private key that is paired with the public key used to encrypt the file.
In the PGP Private Key field, enter your private key. Be sure to include the header and footer of the armored key. This means your entry should begin and end with the following:
-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK----- and -----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
If your key does not begin and end with these strings respectively, it is possible it has not been ASCII armored.
If your private key has been protected with a passphrase, ent",18,docs_integrated-marketing-tools.txt
lytics,Integration Patterns,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools,"er the passphrase in the field labeled PGP Private Key Passphrase. If your private key is not passphrase protected, leave this field empty.
Note: in order for Lytics to decrypt the file successfully, you will need to provide the private key that is paired with the public key that was used to encrypt the file.
Templating
User profile fields can be dynamically inserted into an alert using
templating of supported fields including the alert title, alert subtitle, and alert body fields. Lytics uses Golang's template package to provide this functionality. The data available to you will vary based on the data available on each individual profile.
You can download a customer profile to see a list of fields available on your user profiles. For example, if you want to include a user's name in an alert and the field containing the name is called first_name, a template like the following could be used:
Hey, {{ .first_name }}
Notice the ""."" before the name of the profile field.
Some profiles may no",19,docs_integrated-marketing-tools.txt
lytics,Integration Patterns,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools,"t have a first-name field. To avoid sending an incoherent alert when you don't have the first name field available, a template like the following could be used:
{{ if .first_name }}Hey, {{ .first_name }}{{ else }}I wish I knew you{{ end }}
Alternatively, if you would rather include a default name when the field does not exist on the profile, a template like the following could be used:
Hey, {{.last_name | default ""valued customer""}}
If you would like to make sure that multiple fields on a profile exist, a template like the following could be used:
{{ if and .first_name .last_name }}Hey, {{ .first_name }} {{ .last_name }}{{ else }}I don't know you{{ end }}
To check equality on a particular profile field, you can create a template like the following:
{{ if eq .subscriber_status “subscribed” }}You are a subscriber!{{ else }}You should subscribe!{{ end }}

🚧This document describes a legacy implementation that Lytics is actively deprecating. If you're looking for details on the current SSO implementation, check out the new documentation.
Lytics supports enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) by using Auth0 as a service provider using SAML protocol. Lytics integrates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the IdP initiates SSO. That is, when your end user logs in to their IdP, they will use a global portal for your organization. Users can then click a link or button that will log them into Lytics seamlessly.
Behind the scenes, the IdP will be contacting the Lytics Auth0 service provider to verify the user and redirect them to a logged-in instance of the Lytics app. This document describes the process for integrating with a new IdP that u",6,docs_idp-initiated-sso-legacy.txt
lytics,IDP-initiated SSO (legacy),https://docs.lytics.com/docs/idp-initiated-sso-legacy,"ses SAML.
Service Provider Configuration
To configure SAML for the Lytics service provider some information is required about your IdP. If you have a metadata file that contains SAML provider information this may be appropriate, just make sure that the following information is provided to Lytics Support:
Sign In URL
X509 Signing Certificate (The identity provider public key - if possible encoded in a separate PEM or CER formatted file)
Sign Out URL
Further configuration details such as mappings may need to be provided. Once this information has been received, Lytics can configure the SAML connection in Auth0.
IdP Configuration
After Lytics configures the SAML connection on the service provider, Lytics Support will provide a metadata XML file with the following information in order to complete the IdP configuration. The key fields in this metadata are:
Connection Name
Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL (aka post-back or callback URL)
Entity ID of the Service Provider
With this informa",7,docs_idp-initiated-sso-legacy.txt
lytics,IDP-initiated SSO (legacy),https://docs.lytics.com/docs/idp-initiated-sso-legacy,"tion, your IdP connection can be configured to complete the SSO integration.
Testing SSO
Once all the information has been configured in both the IdP and the Lytics service provider, you can test and verify that the SSO implementation works as expected. If you are using SSO as your only sign-in method, please disable any password restriction or expiration settings that may have been enabled in the UI.
During the testing process, Lytics can be configured to allow both SSO logins and regular username and password (or Google OAuth) login through the app. This allows users to test SSO without disrupting the day-to-day usage of the app.
If requested, once the SSO implementation has been tested and verified, Lytics can disable the use of other logins for an account.
Troubleshooting SSO
If it's known that SSO is going to be added to an account, then the user email addresses added to the account should match the email address present within the IdP. If the email address doesn’t match, then the",8,docs_idp-initiated-sso-legacy.txt
lytics,IDP-initiated SSO (legacy),https://docs.lytics.com/docs/idp-initiated-sso-legacy," login will fail as Lytics will not be able to verify that there is a user with that email address.
For instance, if the email listed in the IdP is abc@123, and within Lytics it’s def@456, then the user will have successfully been verified by their IdP, but the login within Lytics would fail as the authenticated user email would not match the user within Lytics. You would need to create a new user within Lytics with the email address abc@123 for the SSO login to be successful.
It should also be noted that primary accounts are decided as the first account that a user was added to.
Due to this,
users from a single group/organization will often have different primary accounts. This is important for SSO as it will also be the account that the user is logged into at the start of their session. If SSO is enabled as the only means of login on one account and a user attempts to log-in using Google OAuth or their username and password, the login session will fail. The following options are poss",9,docs_idp-initiated-sso-legacy.txt
lytics,IDP-initiated SSO (legacy),https://docs.lytics.com/docs/idp-initiated-sso-legacy,"ible solutions:
Add that user to your IdP.
Other methods of logging in would need to be added (Google OAuth, username/password).
Remove user from all accounts and then add them back with the first account being the account that you want to be their primary account.
Lytics Support can assist in the troubleshooting process. When testing for the first time Lytics can enable logging to help troubleshoot any issues you may encounter. If you are receiving the error message shown below after being redirected to the app, that means there is an issue on the application side.
The Lytics Support team can help debug this if you provide information on the login attempt such as the time of the login and the user and account.
If you’re encountering an error earlier in the login process, such as before you are redirected to the Lytics app, this may be an issue with the SAML configuration either on the IdP or Service provider side. Lytics’ support team can review these issues and coordinate a fix, just",10,docs_idp-initiated-sso-legacy.txt

This guide streamlines the integration of Customer Data Infrastructure (CDI) and Customer Data Platform (CDP) into your marketing technology framework. Given the overlapping functionalities of both tools, distinguishing their roles in marketing activation is crucial. By clearly assigning responsibilities and adhering to best practices for each platform, businesses can improve customer profiling, segmentation, and activation efforts, all while eliminating data redundancies and streamlining processes.
Implementation Overview
Roles and Responsibilities
Give clear roles and responsibilities to each tool in order to limit duplicative processes.

CDP Responsibilities (Lytics): Concentrate on activation, segmentation, and customer interactions. Define the specific data that should be directly ingested into the CDP.
Best Practices
Simultaneous Implementation: Understand the end-state requirements for your data in the CDP to guide the setup of your CDI, avoiding redundant reconfiguration.
Feature Allocation: Assign primary tasks (e.g., identity resolution, segmentation) to one platform to reduce complexity and maintenance challenges.
Key Implementation Steps
Define Tool Roles: Clearly outline why each tool was chosen based on its strengths and intended use in your martech strategy.
Data Flow and Schema: Align data types and formats with primary activation use cases, ensuring CDI processes non-marketing data and CDP focuses on customer engagement data.
Identity Resolution: Develop a joint strategy for both platforms to unify customer profiles promptly, ensuring a seamless customer journey across all touchpoin",7,docs_strategy-for-implementing-a-cdi-and-a-cdp.txt
lytics,CDI and CDP Implementation Strategy,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/strategy-for-implementing-a-cdi-and-a-cdp,"ts.
Activation Channel Allocation: Specify which platform will manage client-side and server-side activations to prevent overlapping functionalities and increased costs.
Specific Considerations
Client-Side vs. Server-Side: Clearly distinguish between the two, utilizing each for its strengths in anonymous and known activations.
Unique Integrations: Treat similar functionalities, like JavaScript tags, as distinct integrations based on their roles within each platform.
Ongoing Maintenance
Regularly update your integration strategy within the Martech Center of Excellence to accommodate new tools and data sources, ensuring consistent and efficient use of your CDI and CDP platforms.
This involves:
Integrating new data sources as per established guidelines.
Continuously evaluating and adapting to new features to solve existing challenges.
Monitor the current solution to make sure roles should not be modified.

A data stream is a continuous flow of data generated from various sources such as websites, mobile apps, email providers, social media, and other digital platforms. Data streams typically involve high volumes of data generated in real-time or near-real-time, making it necessary to process and analyze the data as it arrives.
Lytics allows for creating any number of data streams to provide logical distinctions among data sources in either type or scope. For example, data describing email subscriber attributes should exist on a different data stream than one describing email subscriber activity. This ensures maximum flexibility when defining the relationships between sources and how they ultimately are unified into a materialized user profile.
What is an ""event?""
In Lytics, an ""event"" is an action or activity performed by a user or a customer, s",6,docs_data-streams-1.txt
lytics,Data Streams,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/data-streams-1,"uch as visiting a website, purchasing, or subscribing to a newsletter. As pictured below, events are showcased as independent key/value pairs on a single data stream. These keys are then translated into Fields & Mappings
in order to materialize to user profile for segmentation.
Exploring Data Streams
Lytics will ingest data that is sent to one of Lytics' Collection APIs: the collect API or the bulk API. The bulk API is generally intended for larger imports of offline data, while the collect API is generally intended for more real-time sources and usage.
Viewing Your Data Streams
You can view information about your data streams in your Lytics dashboard by navigating to Conductor > Pipeline > Streams. The primary purpose of this section is to verify that data is successfully being received by Lytics. If your account has multiple data streams, you can view a different stream from the dropdown menu above the graph.
Many integrations have multiple streams. For instance, it is common for ema",7,docs_data-streams-1.txt
lytics,Data Streams,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/data-streams-1,"il integrations to have an activity stream and a user stream. Integration streams should be prefixed to help identify the source. You can find the streams for integration under the documentation for that integration.
📘The number of keys in a data stream can be extremely large. This is normal and does not impact performance. Any keys that comprise less than 0.1% of the data volume OR have not been seen in 7 days will be hidden from display to reduce clutter.
Event Ingress Graph
The event ingress graph shows the number of events collected on a stream for the selected time period (past day, week, month, 3 months, and year)
and interval (hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly). Above the graph, you will find the time the last message from this stream was received, the source of the data stream, and the number of fields in the stream.
📘Last message received strives for real time reporting but can lag under a number of conditions including during bulk imports. If a data stream is not updating as",8,docs_data-streams-1.txt
lytics,Data Streams,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/data-streams-1," expected please contact Lytics Support for assistance.
Raw Keys Table
Below the event ingress graph is the raw keys table. An event may contain any number of key-value pairs. Each record in this table represents a unique raw key seen on the stream in at least one event.
The table has the following information on keys:
ColumnDescriptionNameThe name of the key.Predicted TypeThe assumed data type for the value is determined by sampling the values received.First SeenThe date the key was first seen, according to the date of the event.Last SeenThe last time a key was seen, according to the date of the event.Times SeenThe number of events that contained the key.Unique ValuesThe number of different values seen.Times UsedThe number of user fields that use the key.
In addition to these seven columns, each record in the table can be clicked to open up a set of sample values. This can be used to verify that values are being collected and they match the expected data.
📘If a key has many different ",9,docs_data-streams-1.txt
lytics,Data Streams,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/data-streams-1,"values, the modal may not display all the values for the chosen key.
The table can be filtered in three ways: used vs. unused, common vs. uncommon, and text search.
FilterDescriptionUsedA raw key that is mapped to a user field.UnusedRaw keys are collected and stored but never mapped to user fields.CommonRaw keys that have been seen more often on events relative to other raw keys based on the times seen value.UncommonRaw keys are seldom seen on events relative to other raw keys.
Hiding Keys
Raw event keys can be hidden, but it is important to note that keys cannot be made visible again through the user interface - only through the API. It is recommended that a list is kept of hidden keys in the event one needs to be resurfaced at a later date. If you need assistance, please contact Lytics Support with your key name and account ID.
To hide a key:
Select the checkbox next to the name of the key or keys.
Click Remove selected key.
Final Thoughts
Having logically differentiated data streams",10,docs_data-streams-1.txt
lytics,Data Streams,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/data-streams-1," for different data sources also helps to facilitate a more straightforward process for mapping data from data sources to user profiles. However, integrating data from some data providers can make this distinction difficult.
For example, data routers like Segment or Rudderstack can route data from multiple sources into a single destination, like Lytics.Updated 10 months ago Table of Contents

Lytics provides a variety of valuable metrics that downstream monitoring tools, such as Google Stackdriver or New Relic, can consume. Using industry-standard, inexpensive tools built for alerting and monitoring, you can have visibility into Lytics within your existing ecosystem.
Consuming Metrics Downstream
Once you have connected Lytics to your monitoring tool, there are various ways you can apply metrics from Lytics to support your operational and IT audit processes. Below are a few examples:
Active monitoring - defined by alerting, requires additional configuration within your downstream tools to monitor Lytics.
On-call distribution lists - control who within your operational teams to inform.
Quiet hours - manage within a tool where you are already doing that for other metrics.
Correlation of metrics - show existing metri",6,docs_monitoring-lytics.txt

Operational users - watch for signals without creating a Lytics admin user account.
Anomaly detection - use threshold-based alerts that most monitoring tools have that go beyond the capabilities Lytics provides natively.
Platform Monitoring via Metric API
The Metric API provides access to a variety of metrics that are recorded in the Lytics platform. This API allows you to access segment size metrics, events received per hour, and many workflow-specific metrics.

Lytics Insights provide visibility into how your audiences and campaigns perform and recommend how you may improve engagement, drive conversions, and increase marketing ROI.
You can think of Lytics Insights as a way to connect the data you have with the decisions you are making for marketing campaigns. Defined in a few words, Lytics Insights are:
Actionable: Direct knowledge to your marketing initiatives.
Contextual: Provide actions that are relevant to the Lytics user consuming them.
Explanatory: Describe phenomena in terms of your business processes or outcomes.
Novel: Offer a new understanding of your customers and campaigns.
Insights serve as a key ingredient to achieve marketing personalization. To effectively leverage customer data, you must apply it throughout your campaign planning and execution process. Unlike metrics that remain on a BI dashboa",6,docs_insights.txt
lytics,Insights,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/insights,"rd or report, Lytics Insights are designed be immediately activated in your segmentation and campaign strategies.
If your account package includes Insights, you can access Insights from anywhere in the Lytics UI.
How Insights Work
Insights surface meaningful data and recommended action, enabling you to make better, data-driven decisions during your campaign planning and execution. The core idea behind Insights is simple. Insights are a combination of facts and actions:
Fact: Observable, data-driven information providing demonstrable value. This is a unique set of raw metrics, such as the number of users or the amount of lift.
Action: Suggested behavior based on user role, data source, activation channels, industry, etc. This is the contextualization of a fact into something to be done.
Insights are made possible thanks to the data science capabilities built into Lytics. The heavy lift of processing and interpreting data is automatically handled by machine learning models under-the-hood",7,docs_insights.txt
lytics,Insights,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/insights,".
This is a prime example of how machine learning can augment (not replace) a marketer’s role. Machines efficiently and accurately sift through lots of data, allowing people to then make use of the important information in the most relevant context. For example, a model can predict which users are most likely to churn, and a marketer can then target those at-risk users with a win-back campaign on Facebook.
Insight Cards
Insights are presented as Insight Cards that are available throughout the entire app.
Simply navigate to the left-hand side of the Lytics UI to open the Insights Drawer, which contains a list of Insight Cards unique to your account.
Below is an example of an Insight card and what it's comprised of:
Creation date: When the Insight was generated.
Expiration date: When the Insight will be removed from the drawer. Insights expire after 2 weeks.
Insight statement: The explanation or comparison of noteworthy data will depend on the type of Insight. You can click on an audienc",8,docs_insights.txt
lytics,Insights,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/insights,"e name to view its summary report.
Recommended action: Lytics will suggest how you can apply this Insight to your targeting along with a related use case.
Expanded definition: View more details by clicking the arrow. This example explains the Lytics score or other data field being calculated.
Insights are generated and refreshed on a weekly basis to ensure you are viewing the most recent user data. Insights expire after 2 weeks, so you only target and activate an audience and campaigns during a relevant time frame.
The Insights Drawer will display a maximum of 25 cards at a time. Insights will be created for up to 10 custom audiences, in addition to Lytic's out-of-the-box engagement audiences. Lytics will prioritize Insights based on the statistical significance of the data and the most frequently used audiences.
Compositional Insights
Compositional Insights help you understand the makeup of your audiences. This information can answer, “what makes an audience unique?” and “How should I",9,docs_insights.txt
lytics,Insights,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/insights," target these users differently?”
Compositional Insights make it easier for you to create effective segmentation strategies. They compare data fields within audiences to surface which attributes drive user behavior. Compositional Insights currently include the following:
Audience Pairs
This Insight compares high-value audiences on their levels of engagement. This can take the form of comparing Lytic's out-of-the-box audiences on a particular behavioral score or a custom audience.
As a bite-size piece of information, this Insight Card has provided:
An easy way to leverage Lytics audiences and scores that are derived from data science.
A suggested next step of what to do with this information. For example, you may target these at-risk users with a win-back campaign.
Field Candidates
This Insight compares the prevalence of specific data fields within two audiences. Candidates included are fields used in audience definitions and fields from the Promoted Schema Fields in your Account Settin",10,docs_insights.txt
lytics,Insights,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/insights,"gs.
Having a granular understanding of your audiences allows you to make more strategic targeting decisions. For example, there may be a data field that your organization is paying to collect. If you discover through an Insight Card that this field is not performing as expected in your campaigns, you could save marketing spend by eliminating that field and using others that are shown to be more predictive of user behavior.
Experience Insights
Experience Insights help you track and understand campaign performance. This information can answer, “Which campaigns are resonating with my users?” and “Are my marketing tactics driving engagement or conversions?”
Experience Insights allow you to refine campaigns based on current metrics proactively. Since Lytics Insights are generated and refreshed every week, you can take action to improve a campaign while it’s running.
Experience Insights include the following types:
Experience Management
This Insight will surface when an experience is missing",11,docs_insights.txt
lytics,Insights,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/insights," UTM parameters, which enable Lytics to track conversions from downstream tools such as Facebook.
While this Insight is more straightforward than the other types Lytics offers, it helps you quickly identify when an Experience configuration is incomplete, affecting your ability to track performance and target users who have previously engaged in future campaigns.
Experience Performance
This Insight appears when a significant spike up or down in campaign performance exists. Awareness of such incidents allows you to make the necessary changes to improve campaign ROI.
For example, if conversion rates have rapidly declined for a particular campaign in the last week, you may need to reevaluate and consider changes such as refining your audience, messaging, or campaign tactics.
Activating Insights
Taking action based on your Insights is the most important part of the process. As the introduction explains, Lytics Insights are designed to be actionable. By understanding how users interact with ",12,docs_insights.txt
lytics,Insights,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/insights,"your brand at a granular level, you can iterate campaigns to improve their performance and deliver better user experiences.
Activating against Lytics Behavioral Scores
User engagement is a crucial component of personalization. Each Lytics Score (quantity, frequency, recency, intensity, momentum, propensity) indicates a different aspect of user behavior,
but overall, higher scores indicate high engagement, while lower scores indicate low engagement.
Below are some everyday use cases you might consider, depending on whether the target audience has higher behavioral scores (anything above 50) or lower behavioral scores (anything below 50).
Targeting Users with Low Engagement
There are two main approaches to reaching unengaged users. The first is to drive engagement using a variety of tactics, such as messaging on different channels, targeting based on content affinities, etc. The second approach is to increase marketing efficiency by suppressing these users, thus improving your conversion",13,docs_insights.txt
lytics,Insights,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/insights,"s.
Targeting Users with High Engagement
When creating strategies around your most active users, you will want to keep them engaged by delivering relevant content and establishing a first-party relationship that increases their Lifetime Value (LTV). You can find more users who are similar to your best customers using lookalike audiences.
You can also learn more about what makes these engaged users different, which can inform your overall targeting strategies.
View the Audience summary by clicking the audience name on your Insight Card to see the history of this audience and its characteristics.
Activating against Lytics Content Affinity
Giving your users more of what they love is a great tactic to consider to either drive engagement for less active users or to keep currently active users engaged.Updated almost 2 years ago Table of Contents

V2 Conductor Schema does not have a direct analog for WHERE clauses in V1 schema, or LQL. In V1, for example, it was possible to describe a clause to filter data that is mapped for a stream, such as the following, which ignores events whose _url field contains the string localhost:
WHERE
not(contains(`_url`, ""localhost""))
To achieve the same result in accounts with Conductor Schema turned on, we need to use the Stream Route Rules API, whose endpoints include the following:
GET /v2/stream/rule retrieves a list of all route rules defined in the account
GET /v2/stream/rule/:id retrieves a single route rule by its ID
POST /v2/stream/rule creates a new route rule
POST/PUT /v2/stream/rule/:id upserts an existing route rule by its ID
DELETE /v2/stream/rule/:id deletes an existing route rule by its ID
Route rules ",6,docs_stream-routing-api.txt
lytics,Stream Routing API,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/stream-routing-api,"define data to route from one input stream to another output stream. On ingress, the stream on the record is overwritten from input to output if the rule is active and evaluates to true when executed against the incoming record.
The mechanics of this imply one important distinction relative to V1 WHERE clauses: since route rules describe which records to redirect away from the input stream, rather than which records to evaluate for the input stream, they are in effect the inverse of WHERE clauses. If, for example, we want to ignore urls containing the string localhost from our input stream app in the WHERE clause above, we would need to define a route rule containing the following expression (which is the precise inverse of our WHERE clause):
WHERE
contains(`_url`, ""localhost"")
This tells the system to redirect events matching this expression to a new output stream we define on the route rule object. By convention, if we don't care about mapping records that match our route rule, we ca",7,docs_stream-routing-api.txt
lytics,Stream Routing API,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/stream-routing-api,"ll that output stream {input-stream}_divert, and define the following route rule object (note the need to escape double quotes inside the expression so that our object is valid JSON):
{
""account_id"": ""4f7b525bdba058fc096757a6"",
""active"": true,
""aid"": 12,
""expression"": ""contains(`_url`, \""localhost\"")"",
""input"": ""app"",
""name"": ""Ignore events from localhost"",
""output"": ""app_divert"",
""priority"": 1
}
📘Note: If there is a use case to take all events and route them to the output stream, the expression can hold the string value of ""true"" instead of a logic condition. i.e. ""expression"": ""true""
Our object includes several properties which should be self-explanatory: account_id, aid, and name. The rest are as follows:
active defines whether the rule should be activated against incoming data. Marking a rule as ""active"": false turns it off.
priority indicates the order in which the rules are evaluated (higher priority first) against an event. secondary sorting according the age (newer rules first)",8,docs_stream-routing-api.txt
lytics,Stream Routing API,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/stream-routing-api," is performed when priorities match
📘Note that because these route rules are cached, it will take up to 10 minutes for any updates you make to take effect.
Example
To create our sample route rule, we make the following call. If successful, the response body will include the full route rule object, including a system-generated ID which can be used for subsequent calls against the object:

The Lytics schema visualization tool lets users visualize the relationships between data fields and data sources within the Lytics platform. The visualization provides a graphical representation of the data schema, making it easier for users to understand the structure of their data and how it is connected.
With the schema visualization, users can:
Explore data relationships: The visualization lets users see how different data fields and sources are connected, providing a clear picture of the overall data schema.
Identify data gaps: Users can quickly identify gaps in their data by looking for missing fields or disconnected data sources.
Plan data integrations: The visualization can help users plan data integrations by providing a visual representation of how data from different sources can be ",6,docs_schema-audit.txt
lytics,Planning & Troubleshooting,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/schema-audit,"connected.
Troubleshoot data issues: The visualization can be used to troubleshoot data issues by identifying inconsistencies or errors in the data schema.
Overall, the Lytics schema visualization provides a powerful tool for understanding the data structure within the Lytics platform, enabling users to gain deeper insights and make more informed decisions about their data strategy.
Schema Audit
The Schema Audit provides an overview of how your user fields are being used, the data they contain, and where they are getting that data. It is a great way to see if you have user fields that don't have any data or are not being used for any audience.
On your Lytics dashboard, navigate to Data > Schema Audit. This section offers a snapshot of your data to verify your data mapping techniques.
Filtering the Schema Audit
By default, the Schema Audit includes all user fields in your account. You can filter the report in three different ways.
Users with field allows you to filter fields based the p",7,docs_schema-audit.txt
lytics,Planning & Troubleshooting,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/schema-audit,"ercentage of users in your account who have a user field. For example, if you choose At least 50%, the Schema Audit will be filtered to include only user fields found on 50% or more of the profiles in your account.
Data stream allows you to filter the Schema Audit based on the data source of a user field. Remember that a user field may receive data from multiple data streams.
Search box allows you to search for a specific user field by name.
Interpreting Data Visualizations
The visualizations near the top of the report tell you how user fields are used in your Lytics account. You can click on one of the visualizations to filter the table below.
The first pie chart shows the percentage of user fields that are providing data to build profiles from. In the example above, only 40% of user fields provide data to profiles. That means the other 60% of user fields have no data at all. This number should be as close to 100% as possible.
The second pie chart shows the percentage of user fields t",8,docs_schema-audit.txt
lytics,Planning & Troubleshooting,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/schema-audit,"hat are being used to define audiences. In this example, 94% of user fields are not being used to define any audience.
This account probably mapped too much data, and could trim down their LQL quite a bit.
The third pie chart shows how many user fields are merging data from multiple streams. A common example of merging data from multiple streams is an email user field. Typically, this may read data from your website as well as an email tool. One of Lytics' core competencies is merging data from different sources, so be sure to take advantage of this when creating your user fields.
The distribution bar along the bottom of this section shows you what type of user fields are in your account. Certain types of user fields, especially any containing map, are more expensive and should be used carefully. Mouse over the slices of the distribution bar to see how many user fields of each type are in your account.

Schema versions allow changes to be made in advance of publishing changes directly to the pipeline.
A version combines the changes from fields, mappings, and rankings.
After making changes to fields, mappings, or rankings
Since mappings occur within Lytics' real-time profile pipeline, mappings will only be applied to data that passes through the pipeline and will not be retroactively applied to historical data.
For information on creating profile attributes with data outside of Lytics collection APIs.
Publishing & Reverting Schema Changes
Publishing changes is easy. You can first determine if there are any unpublished changes to your schema by visiting the Versions under the Schema menu in the main navigation within Conductor. There you will see a summary of your version history and the number of unpublished changes.
Publishing Chang",6,docs_schema-versions.txt
lytics,Schema Versions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/schema-versions,"es
If you have unpublished changes, click on the Publish Changes button to review those changes and ultimately publish when ready.
Once you have opted to publish the changes, you will be asked to complete a final review. This review will outline the changes to fields, mappings, and rankings. On the final step, you'll have an opportunity to provide a description to associate with the version and ultimately publish. This ensures any changes have a clear history and reduces any change of accidental schema changes.
Reverting Changes
Discarding Unpublished Changes
If you determine that you would like to discard all the current unpublished changes to the schema, click on the Discard Changes button. This will open a dialog box that will confirm that you wish to reset the schema to the last published version. Select the Discard Changes button to discard all changes.
Reverting Published Changes
If you would like to remove the changes you published in your most recent schema version(s), navigate",7,docs_schema-versions.txt
lytics,Schema Versions,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/schema-versions," to the version you would like to return your schema to and click the Revert to Schema button.
This will create a new unpublished version that contains all the changes needed to return all the fields, mappings and ranks back to the state of the desired schema version. Your will then need to publish these changes in order to complete the reversion.Updated over 1 year ago Table of Contents

Content Setup Suggest EditsLytics' Interest Engines effectively analyze your content with minimal effort required. However, to guarantee that the classification results align with your expectations, conducting a quick test is advisable, as poor metadata can sometimes lead to less-than-optimal outcomes. The most reliable method to ensure comprehensive and satisfactory content classification is to classify a selection of your URLs manually.
Use the left-hand navigation to select Content > Classification.
Click on the section labeled Classify, then paste a URL from your website and press Classify.
After a moment or two, a set of preliminary classification details will come back. Most notably, ensure the Title, Primary Image, and Topics come back with content. If they do not, please refer to our

This view offers a quick way to gauge the quantity of data Lytics has received from your various Sources. Of course, if you would like to explore details for incoming data further you can view more granular details of all connected Sources from the Conductor interface.

For monthly term accounts, quota periods begin on the first of each month and end on the last day of the month. For annual term accounts, quota periods begin at the start of your Lytics subscription. Quotas (unless otherwise stated in your contract) only count for production accounts.

In the Web SDK, Lytics provides a tag that can be placed on your site to collect behavioral data and surface the materialized profile back to your browser in real time. Manual installation instructions are available from within the app at Data Pipeline > SDK > Web SDK.
If your site is a Drupal or Wordpress site, or you use Google Tag Manager we recommend using one of these turnkey methods to install the Lytics Tag:
Drupal
For Drupal users, getting up and running is as simple as installing the official Lytics Drupal module. Once you have the module added to your site using composer or another preferred method, you will want to complete the following configuration steps:
Visit the Configuration page either from the module details in the Extend section of Drupal or directly from the Configuration sect",6,docs_developer-quickstart-3-install-lytics.txt
lytics,1. Install the Lytics Tag,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/developer-quickstart-3-install-lytics,"ion (/en/admin/config/system/lytics).
Add a valid API Token for your Lytics account. Be sure to give that token admin privileges, as that will unlock account verification and direct access to all Lytics systems responsible for surfacing and managing profiles and personalization. This token should also have no expiration, as it will need continued access to your Lytics account. For more information visit our Access Token documentation.
With your token entered. Ensure the Enable Tab setting is selected. This will automatically place the Lytics JavaScript SDK onto all public pages of your site.
Upon saving configuration, your account details will be surfaced. Be sure to verify that your token is for the Lytics account you are currently configuring.
That's it!
WordPress
A formal WordPress plugin is currently under development and coming soon.
Google Tag Manager
From the left-hand navigation to select Data Pipeline > SDK > Web SDK.
Setup and install Google Tag Manager.

lytics,1. Install the Lytics Tag,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/developer-quickstart-3-install-lytics,"TML tag and place the Lytics JavaScript snippet into the text box.
Ensure the tag is triggered on the pages you desire. We recommend using the All Pages default trigger to start.
Submit and publish your Google Tag Manager version.
Testing the Lytics Tag Installation
Once the tag has been installed, validate a successful installation via one of the three following methods:
Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension (Recommended)
The Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension makes validation and exploration simple. Once you've installed the extension as outlined above:
Open the extension and ensure it has been activated.
The interface will display a message to confirm the correct installation of the Lytics tag and relevant configuration details.
In-app Verification Assistant
We've built a simple tool to validate that data flows into your Lytics account. Please note that the collected events may take a few minutes to reflect in the UI.
Select Vault using the product switcher at the top left.

As a service provider and data processor, Lytics assists its customers in enhancing security and meeting privacy and data protection obligations, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA).
Listed below are the compliance-enabling functionalities Lytics provides. As used below, personally identifiable information (PII) has the same meaning in the CCPA and is meant to include “personal data” as defined in the GDPR. Please consult your company’s legal counsel or privacy professional about what privacy and data protection requirements your company must comply with.
Lytics recognizes that its customers are the data controllers of the PII, which Lytics processes on their behalf. Each Lytics customer maintains",6,docs_privacy-and-data-protection.txt
lytics,Privacy and Data Protection,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/privacy-and-data-protection," control over which PII sources and destinations to use with Lytics and the types and content of PII shared between its sources and destinations. Lytics does not sell PII or supplement its customers’ respective PII with third-party data except via customer-directed integrations.
Access Control
Restrict access to personal information by role.
Role Based Access Controls (RBAC):
Account Admins can easily add and remove account users. Lytics has various defined user roles with respective permissions.
Single Sign On (SSO):
Add SSO to your user login process to enhance security.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA):
Add MFA to your user login process to enhance security.
Restrict access to PII:
You can indicate any user fields that contain PII via the private fields account setting. These fields will be hidden for anyone who does not have Admin, Data Manager, or User Search roles. You should verify with Lytics Support that the field hiding in the segment scan is also enabled for your account to",7,docs_privacy-and-data-protection.txt
lytics,Privacy and Data Protection,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/privacy-and-data-protection," ensure these fields are also hidden there.
Data Mapping
Map personal information processed by Lytics, including sources and destinations.
Audit your data schema:
Use the Schema Audit feature to see what user fields are being populated, the data contained, the source(s), and if that data is being used in audience definitions.
Determine third-party data sources:
You can see the third-party data sources from which you send data to Lytics using the Lytics UI by navigating to Data > Data Streams. The ""default"" stream will contain your web data unless otherwise configured. You will see your other integrations in the list of stream names using the drop-down menu at the top right. Each stream page will show you the last time Lytics received data.
Determine third-party data destinations:
You can view the activity history for a data destination using the Lytics UI by navigating to Data > Integrations. Click on the tile for the integration in question. If you're already running the integration, ",8,docs_privacy-and-data-protection.txt
lytics,Privacy and Data Protection,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/privacy-and-data-protection,"you will automatically be taken to the overview page that shows a list of running imports and exports and the history of events for those works.
Notice and Consent
Manage user consent and preference data.
Obtaining Customer Consent
Lytics customers are responsible for obtaining consent for collecting and transferring PII to Lytics for processing. You can use the Lytics JavaScript Tag to collect PII about customers' online behavior. One consent mechanism is to implement a custom tag and trigger in your Google Tag Manager account and assign that trigger to the Lytics JS tag. See how to manage consent with Google Tag Manager.
For sites not using Google Tag Manager, customer consent on the web can be managed in several ways. Consent triggers can be listened to by adding a snippet of custom JavaScript to your site. Another alternative is to use a cookie-consent solution, many of which exist. Github has documented a free solution, including demos. The Lytics JS Tag can be configured to consu",9,docs_privacy-and-data-protection.txt
lytics,Privacy and Data Protection,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/privacy-and-data-protection,"me triggers from any of these solutions to manage consent for your customers.
Recording Proof of Consent:
Schema fields may be established for the purpose of storing customer consent.
Privacy Policy Notice:
When you use a Lytics modal to collect user information, you should include a link to your organization’s privacy policy regarding the treatment of the PII collected. A link can be added to any modal created using the Experience Editor.
Age Gating:
If you have collected accurate age data, you can build audiences that target or exclude certain ages.
Responding to Consumer Requests
Respond to the data subject (consumer) requests in compliance with regional and state privacy and data protection requirements.
Personal Data Access:
Using the find a user feature, enter the identifying details provided by the consumer to locate their profile. The profile ""created"" date refers to the earliest date Lytics collected any data on this user.
Personal Data Correction:
If user profile data require",10,docs_privacy-and-data-protection.txt
lytics,Privacy and Data Protection,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/privacy-and-data-protection,"s correction, you must send the corrected data to Lytics, which will be remapped to convert the resulting user profile information.
Determining Categories of Personal Data Collected:
You can use the Lytics UI to obtain information about the categories and specific pieces of PII collected on a consumer in the past 12 months. Again using the find a user feature, you can view the fields of populated data and determine the appropriate consumer PII categories to disclose to a requesting data subject/consumer.
Personal Data Portability:
We support the export of profile information via the Lytics UI or APIs. An individual’s profile data from Lytics will be downloaded as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file. JSON is a common, machine-readable file format.
Personal Data Deactivation/Suppression:
You can establish audiences to enforce consumer suppression and “do not market” choices and prioritize those choices when establishing marketing journeys for your consumers. These audiences can be e",11,docs_privacy-and-data-protection.txt
lytics,Privacy and Data Protection,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/privacy-and-data-protection,"xported from Lytics to your downstream tools or ""data destinations.""
Personal Data Deletion:
We provide a method for deleting users via the Lytics UI. Our API may also be used for this purpose. This will send a deletion request to the Lytics platform, which will process the request for the customer identifier provided.
SOC 2 Audits
An independent auditor has examined Lytics platform controls and confirmed they are in accordance with the Service Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type II Trust Services Principles for Security, Availability, and Confidentiality. You can learn more about our SOC 2 Type II examination in this blog post.
Lytics will continue to engage independent auditors to conduct SOC 2 Type II audits regularly and make our audit report available to our customers and prospects under an NDA. In addition, we retain independent security firms to conduct regular penetration tests and vulnerability scans on our systems and code, respectively. Our underlying cloud services provider,",12,docs_privacy-and-data-protection.txt
lytics,Privacy and Data Protection,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/privacy-and-data-protection," Google, also submits to regular, multiple independent audits, including SOC 2 Type II audits.
Safeguards and Transfers
Lytics Data Protection Safeguards:
Lytics and its data hosting partner, Google, have implemented numerous safeguards to protect the PII that Lytics processes on its customers' behalf. External auditors audit these safeguards on an annual basis. For more information regarding these safeguards, please ask your Lytics account manager.
Transfers of Personal Data from EU:
Lytics participates in the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks regarding collecting, using, and retaining personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. We have certified with the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. Please let your account manager know if your organization requires Lytics to enter into the EU Standard Contractual Clauses regarding data transfer from the EU to the U.S.

As businesses continue to collect and utilize customer data to power their marketing efforts, obtaining, managing, and enforcing proper consent is crucial. This is important for complying with various privacy laws and regulations and maintaining trust with customers. This document will explore the importance of granularity in a consent strategy and how Lytics can assist in the consent management process. We will cover best practices to consider and provide guidance on where to get started. The following four steps will be outlined:
Data Collection: How to collect consent adequately from disparate sources consistently.
Profile Materialization: How to flexibly surface the state of consent to individual user ",6,docs_consent.txt
lytics,Consent & Privacy,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/consent,"profiles.
Segmentation: How can the required consent rules be enforced when driving downstream campaigns?
Maintenance: How to ensure that your consent strategy scales and flexes to your ongoing market conditions without fail?
By following these steps, businesses can establish a solid and effective consent management strategy that respects customer privacy and builds trust.
Data Collection
To maintain compliance with data privacy regulations, businesses need a clear and flexible path for collecting consent data. Lytics offers a range of SDKs and data collection APIs to support this effort. When approaching consent data collection, it is essential to consider the following:
The source of the data and any inherent limitations. Can it be real-time, or does it need to be batch?
The granularity of the consent. Is this a simple boolean, on or off, or is this something more granular, like opting into a particular communication method?
Additional context related to the consent that may be impor",7,docs_consent.txt
lytics,Consent & Privacy,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/consent,"tant for your needs. Are there specific forms that are being consented to or a unique source?
To address these considerations, Lytics has developed a suggested schema to get you started. Of course, this can always be customized via Conductor to meet your specific needs.
Data Structure
Effective consent management requires a comprehensive set of properties that can be deployed to ensure compliance and maintain customer trust. These properties should cover various aspects of data collection, storage, and usage and provide businesses with the tools to manage consent-related data effectively.
Schema PropertyDescriptionEvent NameUsing a standardized event name for consent collection provides crucial context that can be utilized through if/else rules for individual mappings. By leveraging different event names, such as ""consent-type-1"" versus ""consent-type-2,"" it becomes easier to differentiate between multiple types of consent on a single profile as events stream in and is subsequently mapp",8,docs_consent.txt
lytics,Consent & Privacy,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/consent,"ed. This approach enables businesses to maintain a more granular and organized record of consent-related data.ConsentedA clear and concise confirmation, or lack thereof, reduces the possibility of accidentally mapping consent when consent has been denied or not yet collected.LocationAn optional parameter to build context around a user's location that may become important. Are they consenting to something location specific?DateAn optional parameter to build context around when consent was most recently given. Date may be important if consent is valid for a specified length of time and may help support efforts to gather consent in the event that the consent timeframe has lapsed.DocumentsThe ""documents"" array within the default schema represents additional context that can be used to specify the source of consent. For instance, this field can indicate whether the consent was given via a global site-wide agreement or a specific call to action during a purchase. While the data manager deter",9,docs_consent.txt
lytics,Consent & Privacy,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/consent,"mines the values and format of this field, including this information helps ensure that critical context is not lost during execution.
Examples
📘We are here to help!Consent is not a one size fits all scenario. Each customers data and business goals are unique. Before deploying any of the following examples it is always recommended to consult with your Technical Account Manager or a Solutions Architect.
Lytics deploys a flexible data model, and though the following is not representative of every method of collection, we've highlighted two working examples leveraging our available SDKs as a baseline:
Collecting Consent via the Web: Lytics JavaScriptTag
JavaScriptjstag.send({
""event"": ""form-submit"",
""consent"": {
""purpose"": ""global"",
""location"": ""Portland, OR"",
""documents"": [""generic-submit-form""],
""consented"": true
}
})
Collecting Consent via Mobile: Lytics iOS SDK
Lytics.shared.consent(
name: ""consent-1"",
identifiers: AnyCodable([
""userid"": ""my-fake-userid-1234""
]),
attributes: AnyCodabl",10,docs_consent.txt
lytics,Consent & Privacy,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/consent,"e([
""firstName"": ""Kevin"",
""lastName"": ""McCalister""
]),
consent: AnyCodable([
""documents"": [
""terms_jan_2023"",
""sharing_policy_jan_2023""
],
""location"": ""Chicago, IL"",
""consented"": true
])
)
📘When using Lytics SDKs, you do not have to include date within the data passed in the consent event. The timestamp of the consent event can be used to create the field and mapping for the date of consent.
Profile Materialization
Building from the collection strategy outlined in Collecting Consent Data, we must determine how to materialize the consent-related data we've just collected to user profiles for segmentation. This can be achieved in a variety of ways. Regardless of the approach, however, it is essential to consider the level of granularity of the consent.
Granularity
When collecting consent from users, obtaining granular consent for each specific use of a customer's personal data is an important consideration. Granular consent means that customers are provided with a clear understanding of ",11,docs_consent.txt
lytics,Consent & Privacy,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/consent,"the exact purposes for which their personal data will be used and can choose to consent or withhold consent for each specific use case.
For example, a business may seek granular consent from a customer to collect their email address and use it to send them promotional emails but not to share the email address with third-party partners for advertising purposes. This approach allows customers to make more informed decisions about how their personal data is used and provides greater control over their privacy.
Obtaining granular consent not only requires careful planning and clear communication with customers about the specific use cases for their personal data but also a rock-solid means for enforcing an individual's consent wishes across all future touchpoints.
Schema
Enforcement begins by ensuring consent wishes are accurately materialized on each user's profile. This is done by first defining consent-related attributes to be used in segmentation.
Field Definition
When defining profile",12,docs_consent.txt
lytics,Consent & Privacy,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/consent," fields, there are two primary considerations. What type of field should be used, such as a string or a map and how do you want to handle data merging when profiles are stitched?
Field Type
TypeBenefitsDrawbacksMap (Recommended)A map is the most straightforward approach, allowing you to add additional context with minimum overhead. You create one field and map multiple data points to that field.During segmentation, maps may be slightly more challenging to navigate. Because the keys that are nested under the map are not part of the top-level schema, you'll need to drill into the field to build segments vs. searching at the top level.StringWhen building segments, because all consent fields would be at the top level of the schema, it may be easier to find and select the contextual data.When using a string, you can only store a single value. This represents a heavier lift during the initial setup, as you'll need to create many fields to facilitate a single consent use case.
Merge Operator
",13,docs_consent.txt
lytics,Consent & Privacy,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/consent,"Type String
Because consent is something that may change for a consumer over time, the values must represent the most recent data. As such, the latest merge operator is always recommended. This means that as additional data is stitched to a user profile, the most recent events that are mapped to a field will win.
Example String
Type Map
For a more complex or granular consent strategy, the map field type can be very helpful in accurately managing consent. As such, the merge merge operator is always recommended when trying to keep the key-value pairs up to date to the most recent consent state. This means that as additional data is stitched to a user profile, the most recent events that are mapped to a key-value pair will win.
Example Map
Mapping Definition
Mappings are then leveraged to determine how data from any number of streams map to the defined field. In the example below, we take a simple approach to map the boolean value of true or false to the consent field if the consent is re",14,docs_consent.txt
lytics,Consent & Privacy,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/consent,"lated to marketing-consent.
Though this is one elementary example, the same practice can be replicated to ensure a consent attribute has the status, timestamp, and context of any important policies or sources for segmentation.
Example
Segmentation
Businesses can better understand their customers and create more effective campaigns by breaking down audiences into smaller, more targeted segments. Here we will discuss best practices for constructing ""building block"" audiences related to consent that can then be leveraged in campaign audiences. This progressive approach ensures consent rules are enforced while minimizing ongoing maintenance overhead.
Building Blocks
Building Block Audiences provide the perfect means to maintain consent-related rules and extend the ruleset to all campaign audiences. The number and these audiences will depend on the granularity of your consent strategy. Still, as a basic example, we recommend creating both a ""has consented"" and ""has not consented"" counterpar",15,docs_consent.txt
lytics,Consent & Privacy,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/consent,"t for each level of consent.
This can be done simply through the GUI for our powerful segmentation engine, as shown below:
Campaign Segments
Once you have the necessary building blocks constructed, you can quickly integrate that rule set into your campaign audiences again through the GUI for our segmentation engine. The example below outlines a use case where you want to target high-value users who have opted in.
Global Job Segment Filter (Consent)
Configure a segment to prevent profiles from being sent to downstream destinations based on consent status or another relevant filter. This ensures that individuals who should be excluded will not be activated downstream.

Implementation Technique: API",19,docs_acoustic.txt
lytics,Acoustic,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/acoustic," Integration , Audience Trigger Integration .
Frequency: Real-time Integration.
Resulting data: Lytics users are exported to Acoustic Relational Table.
This integration utilizes the Acoustic Relational Table Management api to export user data from Lytics to the Acoustic Relational Table. Once the export is started, the job:
Creates or writes to the following tables depending on the configuration of the job (see the example below for a visual example),
User table - the user identifier plus all scalar fields will be written to this table.
Audience table - the user identifier plus a boolean (Yes/No) column for each Lytics audience exported. Users that belong to the audience will have true as value in the respective audience column, and similarly, will have false if the user does not belong to the audience.
Non-scalar tables - for each non-scalar field exported a separate table will be created.
For sets, the table will have a column for the user identifier plus a column called lytics_value",20,docs_acoustic.txt
lytics,Acoustic,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/acoustic," with a row written for each value in the set.
For maps, the table will have a column for the user identifier plus two columns, lytics_key and lytics_value with a row written for each key/value pair in the map.
As users enter or exit the audience, rows will added or updated in the tables above
The updates will be sent to Acoustic every 5 minutes or a batch of 1000 users, whichever occurs first.
Fields
You can export any Lytics user fields to Acoustic Relational Table. Lytics allows you to map user fields with the corresponding table columns as part of job configuration. The job also has option to create column in Acoustic table for Lytics user field.

The Identity Explorer is a powerful feature within the Lytics platform, crafted to offer you an extensive and thorough examination of an individual user's Customer 360 (C360) profile. This tool not only improves your capacity to comprehend the composition of a user's profile from diverse sources but also grants access to a wealth of attributes and insights associated with the user.
Key Sections
The Identity Explorer is organized into several key sections, each offering a unique perspective into the consumer:
Identity
In the ""Identity"" section, you can explore the relationships between unique identifiers that establish connections across the various channels the consumer engages with. The ""Identifier List"" provides a detailed overview of the keys and values used for linking, while the ""Identity Graph"" visually represents these relat",6,docs_identity-explorer.txt
lytics,Identity Explorer,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/identity-explorer,"ionships. This section helps you understand how the consumer is identified and linked across platforms.
Profile Fields
The ""Profile Fields"" section encompasses an exhaustive catalog (feature store) of attributes along with their corresponding values linked to the customer's profile. This encompasses default schema fields from connected tools, custom attributes, and many inferred or machine learning-based attributes generated by Lytics. This section offers an expansive overview of the consumer's data, facilitating precise targeting and personalized interactions.
Searching & Filtering
The ""Profile Fields"" view can be filtered by either typing in a query or selecting any combination of pre-built filters. We find it most effective to filter by the field categories to simplify the view during exploration.
Raw Data
For developers and data enthusiasts, the ""Raw Data"" section offers a JSON representation of the complete profile.
Behavior
In the ""Behavior"" section, you'll find a graphical repre",7,docs_identity-explorer.txt
lytics,Identity Explorer,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/identity-explorer,"sentation of Lytics' nine behavioral scores. These scores offer valuable insights into the user's engagement patterns across channels, helping you tailor marketing strategies and campaigns to their preferences.
Content Affinity
The ""Content Affinity"" section provides a graphical representation of product and content-based affinity scores for the user. It reveals the user's preferences and interests, enabling you to make data-driven recommendations and content suggestions.
Activity
The ""Activity"" section overviews the user's activity over time. You can track when they are most active and identify the best times to communicate with them. This historical data helps optimize the timing of your interactions for maximum engagement.
Deleting Profiles
In support of GDPR Profile Administrators may also delete a single profile or download the profile data to provide to a consumer directly if requested.Updated over 1 year ago Table of Contents

lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"nRecommend Content CampaignCampaign ReportingCampaign ManagementBuilding Audiences with Campaign DataAudiences Suggest EditsIntroduction
Audiences are central to creating personalized marketing using Lytics. It is how groups of users get targeted and defines how cross-channel user data is used in campaigns. Lytics offers audiences as a tool that operates on user fields as well as other audiences. This provides the ability to craft audiences that target one user, every user, or any number in between.
Lytics audiences are automatically kept up to date. As time passes, an audience that once targeted 500 users may grow to target 10,000. This is great if your audience is targeting engaged users who have shown interest in your upcoming product, but not so great if your audience targets users with outstanding support tickets. Lytics makes it easy to find these insights so your campaign strategies can be adjusted accordingly.
Audiences can be used in Lytics Experiences, third-party ad campaign",6,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"s, and tools like Google BigQuery for advanced reporting. When all of that isn’t enough, the Lytics APIs provide deep integrations with the Lytics platform.
📘Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding the Audiences tab and clicking Audiences. Once on the Audiences page, click on the
+ Create New Audience button.
Creating Audiences
Building new audiences allows you to target specific groups of your users. Why send the same email to your entire audience? Instead, send emails to distinct audiences with content that you know those users enjoy. Lytics gives you the ability to create audiences based on cross channel user data, behaviors and interests.
Audiences can be built using existing audiences, user content affinity, your personalization campaigns, or by custom rules utilizing any user fields in your Lytics account. Create rulesets by combining multiple audiences and boolean logic to target users with as much or as little granularity as you require.
Lytics upda",7,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"tes your audiences automatically. Once an audience is built, users will join or leave whenever they match (or fail to match) the rules you have set. Export your audiences, often in real-time, to your integrated marketing tools giving you the power of Lytics however you engage with your users.
📘Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding the Audiences tab and clicking Audiences. Once on the Audiences page, click on the
+ Create New Audience button.
Building Audiences: Existing Audiences
The Existing Audiences tab in the audience builder contains a list of all existing audiences and their size categorized by audience type such as characteristic. Characteristics are pre-built audiences pertaining to single user attributes such as location or behavior.
Keep in mind that the audience sizes you see in this list are not real-time. They are updated every few hours for performance reasons. When creating or editing an audience, however, you will always see real-time numb",8,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"ers so that you can make precise decisions based on accurate data.
You can use the Filter by Audience Type drop-down to filter the list or use the Search box to quickly find an audience by name.
Select an audience or characteristic to add it to the definition of the audience you are building or editing.
Building Audiences: Content Affinity
The Content Affinity tab in the audience builder is used to add Affinity-based rules to your audience. Since Affinities are a group of related Topics, this allows you to effectively target users interested in several subjects or products.
In the example above, we created a ""Lavender"" Affinity for an online beauty store, which includes 6 Topics such as ""lavender"", ""lavender lotion"", and ""lavender luxury."" Instead of creating an audience with 6 rules (one per Topic), we just select our Lavender Affinity that contains those 6 Topics.
Once you choose an Affinity for your audience, you will be able to select the range of affinity values. The histogram dis",9,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"plays the distribution of user interest for the selected Affinity and is helpful to build an audience that has the desired size. By default, users with Any Affinity are selected. You can choose a built-in range by clicking any of the Affinity buttons or, to set a custom range, use the slider to refine the range of users to target. As you change the range, the total number of users that fit the range is shown in the right column.
As soon as you create an Affinity, Lytics start scoring users against it as they interact with your content or products. For active users, you can expect this number to start populating within a few days. For inactive users, it can take up to 2 weeks for them to be scored against an Affinity. So it's recommended that you create Affinities in advance of the audience needed for an Affinity-based campaign.
Topic-Based Audiences
Under the Custom Rule tab in the Audience Builder, you can find the existing audiences based on Topics in your content taxonomy. If you wa",10,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"nt to create new audiences based on a single Topic, you can do so as follows:
Search for ""Topics"" in the Custom Rule tab of the Audience Builder
Select the Topic of interest.
Set the threshold according to the desired users' level of interest in that Topic.
Once you hit ""Add Condition"", the custom rule for a Topic will look like this:
Although Topics are still supported in the Audience Builder, we strongly recommend you use Affinities to build audiences for a more efficient workflow and more effective targeting.
Inferred Content Affinity
Some users may find a field named Inferred Content Affinity when trying to build affinity or topic based audiences. This field contains topics that a user could be interested in even though they may not have interacted with the topics directly. To learn more about how these inferrences are made, you can read about our content taxonomy process. Note that topic affinity already includes this information, but this field contains only inferred affinity. We",11,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences," would also recommend not using this field to build audiences as it is not a wholistic view of a user's affinity.
Building Audiences: Custom Rules
The Custom Rules tab in the audience builder is used to add any rule based on a user field to the audience being built or edited.
Custom rules allow for ultimate access of all data that is aggregated in user fields. Custom rules are simple statements that can be combined to create very precise audiences. Using them correctly requires a thorough understanding of the data being used, but there is no replacement for this level of segmentation.
🚧Audiences Field Value LimitsAudiences can have a maximum of 1,000 field values. ""Values"" in this context apply to a single evaluation against a user field.When exceeded, the error message ""Audience too large! Remove values to save this audience"" will be displayed. For example, the following scenarios would trigger the alert:
An audience with a single rule that supports multiple values ( e.g. contains one",12,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences," of) with 1001+ values.
An audience with 1001+ user field rules each with a single evaluation (e.g. exists).
Any variation in between such as two rules each containing over 500 evaluations, etc.
The user field list displays all the fields in your account. The Source drop-down can be used to filter on the data stream the user field came from. The Includes drop-down can be used to filter user fields on the percentage of users that have a field. Use the Search input to search for a user field by name.
Generally, to add a Custom Rule to an audience definition:
Choose a User Field
Choose an operator (e.g., text contains, value is less than)
Choose a value
There are variations to this general procedure based on the type of the user field and the operator chosen.
User Field Types
How you work with user fields in the Custom Rules tab will depend on way the field is mapped in on the user profile.
Numeric User Fields
Numeric user fields are most commonly used for data that is counted. For instan",13,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"ce, the number of times a visitor has been to a website or the number of times a subscriber has opened an email. Exact values can be matched, but more commonly, inequalities are expressed.
Examples:
Total Number of Visits must equal 5: Any user who has visited 4 times, 6 times, or any number of times other than 5 will not be matched by this rule.
Total Number of Visits must be less than 3: Any user who has visited 0, 1, or 2 times will be matched by this rule.
Text User Fields
Text User fields are commonly used for words and miscellaneous information. For instance, a user’s first name. Since there is no mathematical relationship between two text values, the operations used are generally exact match or partial match.
There are 5 operator options when making audiences with text user fields:
Equal: The value for the field you want the audience to have. Format and character spacing for the value must match exactly what is in the data stream. You can select the value by interacting with the",14,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences," visualization or be promoted with available values by typing into the search bar.
Contain: The text entered (case sensitive and exact order) appears within a value for the field.
Be Like: Use the wildcard character * along with text to decide the parts of values you want to match. E.g., test will only match on the exact string test, while test* will match strings starting with test, such as ""testing"", and *test* will match any string that has test in it, such as ""my test case"".
Equal one of: Add each, exact value you want included individually. A new search bar will appear after each selection. You can remove values from the list using the “x” to the left of the value. The logic for each of these rules follows the logic from “Equal”.
Exist: Excludes everyone that does not have a value for the field.
Examples
First Name must equal Ash: Only users named Ash will be matched.
First name must contain Ash: Any user named Ash will be matched. Additionally, anyone named Ashley, Ashton, or any",15,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences," other name that has the letters ""Ash"" next to each other will be matched. Dash or Natasha will NOT be matched - as these do not have an “A.” To make an audience that includes these, create a second rule set for “First name must contain ash.”
Date User Fields
Date user fields are commonly used for any data that represents a point in time. For instance, the last time a user visited a website. Most commonly, a date is chosen to divide the people who fall before or after that date. You will need to select both your starting point and a direction in time for your custom rule.
Your starting point could be a fixed point in time (useful for milestone events, like product launches) or a relative point in time (useful for scheduled follow ups).
Since each rule only handles going forward or backward from a single point in time, you may need to create two rules that work together to bound a range of time. One rule will capture all dates after the first point in time, and a second rule will captur",16,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"e all dates before a later point in time.
Some date fields have a natural boundary, such as Last Visits, which will never include a date in the future. If you want all Last Visits from a point in time up until now, you would only need to create one rule.
Examples
Last Visit must be Before June 22, 2016: Created by selecting Specific Date and the direction Before. This rule includes only users who have not visited since the 22nd of June.
Last Visit must be After 3 days in the past: Created by selecting Relative Date, entering 3 days In the past and selecting the direction After. This rule includes only users who have visited in the last three days.
Subscription End Date must be within the next 30 days: Created by building two rules: one to set the start date to always be the current date and the other to set the end date to 30 days in the future relative to the current date.
Create the first rule by selecting Relative Date, After, entering 0 Days, selecting In the past, and clicking Add",17,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences," Condition.
Create the second rule by selecting Relative Date, Before, 30 Days, In the future, and clicking Add Condition.
This audience will now include all users who have a subscription ending in the next 30 days beginning with the current date.
Set User Fields
Set user fields are commonly used for collecting related data over time. For instance, all the URLs a user has visited. These fields are generally used much like text user fields, even though the data is structured differently.
Examples
All URL Paths Ever must contain one of
/blog, /products, or /about: Any user who has visited any one of these three paths will be matched.
Followed Sports must contain Baseball: Any user who follows Baseball will be matched. This is true whether they only follow Baseball or follow Baseball in addition to Football, Hockey, and Bowling.
Map/Nested User Fields
Map user fields are used to add hierarchy to a dynamic domain of data. For instance, Events By Device is a count of all events, but grouped",18,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences," by each device. So instead of building a rule by only specifying the count, the rule is built by first specifying the device, then the count. The device could be thought of as an additional, dynamic user field that is nested under the map user field.
Selecting a Key
When using a map user field, the first step is selecting the dynamic user field to build a rule with, called a key. Using the URLs Visited example, the keys could include any numeric value. Since these keys are dynamic,
counts will be updated automatically.
Building the Condition
Once a key is selected a condition is built. The type of the nested user field is called the value type. In the case of URLs Visited, the value type is numeric. When building audiences with nested fields, the visualization chart will not display for mapped fields to minimize page load times.
Examples
Events By Device (Desktop) must be greater than 5: Only users who have visited the website more than 5 times on a desktop will be matched. If a user ",19,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"has visited more than 5 times on the mobile web, they will not be matched.
Signup Date for Event (Personalization Webinar) must be within the last 7 days: Only the users who signed up for the Personalization Webinar in the last week will be matched. Users who signed up more than 7 days ago will not be matched. Users who signed up for a different event in the last 7 days will also not be matched.
Out of the Box Custom Rules
Some user fields are mapped by default and populated through the use of the Lytics Javascript tag and Experiences. These out of the box fields can be incredibly useful when building audiences using Custom Rules.
Lytics Javascript Tag
Assuming that you have not made changes to the 'default' web LQL file that is automatically created when the Lytics Javascript Tag is installed, the following custom rules are available to you for use when building audiences.
RuleDescriptionAll channels used (web, email, etc.)All the channels a user has been active in based on the data i",20,docs_audiences.txt

When data is collected from the Lytics JavaScript Tag, that request will include the user-agent of the client that was used to initiate the request.

Experiences
There are a variety of use cases that involve targeting users who have engaged with previous marketing campaigns. For example, if a user converted on an Iterable Experience email, and you want to follow up with an SMS message. The steps below will walk you through how to create an audience to target users who were reached by or clicked on an Experience.
Navigate to Experiences and search for the one you would like to use.
You will need to get an ID for the Experience, which differs depending on the Experience type:
For Lytics Web Personalization Experiences: Look up the URL for this Experience and locate the long string of numbers of letters as highlighted below. Save this to your clipboard.
For all other Experience types: open developer tools and navigate to the “Network” tab. Refresh the page and filter the requests by “experience”. Find the response that looks similar to the example below, and save",24,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences," the external_id value (nested under vehicle) to your clipboard.
Note: You can also use the Experience API to fetch the current Experience by ID to get the full payload, including the Experience's external_id.
In your Lytics account, navigate to Audiences > Create New Audience.
In the audience builder, select Custom Rule and search for the provider of the Experience you would like to segment on.
After you enter a provider, you should see a field for conversions and reach on those Experience types. Select the action you wish to segment off of.
Copy and paste the ID you copied from step 2 into the text box.
Choose Exist as your operator and add the condition to your audience.
Select Add Condition. You now have an audience based on past interactions with an Experience. You can save the audience as is, or continue to add rules based on your use case.
Building Audiences: Multiple Rules and Rule Sets
All audience definitions are comprised of rules based on existing audiences, content affinit",25,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"y, campaigns, and custom rules. You may have noticed that after you add your first rule in the audience builder you have the option to Add New Rule or Add New Rule Set. Adding new rules and rulesets, and setting the conditions for their interaction, gives you the ability to refine which users your audiences target.
Working With Multiple Rules
This audience has a single rule: included all users with the characteristic Behavior: Perusers. This will select all users with an intensity score of 20 or less but with a frequency score of 20 or greater. These are users who interact often but not on a deep level. You can refine this rule further by clicking Add New Rule.
This audience now also includes a rule for users who have a low content affinity for Technology content. Now that it has been added, there are three numbers of interest. The first number, 87,650, is the number of users with the characteristic Behavior: Perusers. The second number, 466,730, is the number of users who have low aff",26,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"inity for Technology content. The third number, 11,514, are the users who meet both of these conditions.
Clicking the And/Or toggle, will switch the way the two rules intereact. The audience now includes all 542,921 users who either have the characteristic Behavior: Perusers or have low afffinity for Technology content.
Excluding Rules
In addition to the And/Or toggle, there is the Included/Excluded toggle. This toggle inverts a condition.
This audience contains a rule that targets the 159,084 users with the characteristic Browser / OS: Mobile or users who have used a mobile devices.
Clicking the Include/Exclude toggle the audience will now target the 705,166 users who do not have the characteristic Browser / OS: Mobile.
The sum of the two numbers will be the total audience size that meets those rule(s).
This is especially apparent when using a rule such as Created Timestamp Exists. Every user in Lytics will have a timestamp of when they were created. Therefore, the number of users who",27,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences," do not meet the condition of having a created timestamp will always be 0.
Working With Rule Sets
When building elaborate audiences, having a single set of rules that are evaluated using either an AND or an OR is not enough. A ruleset is a set of rules that itself can be used as a rule for an even larger set of rules that is again evaluated using an AND or an OR.
This audience has two rulesets. The first ruleset has one rule: all users who have the characteristic Email Capture Status: Known Email. The second ruleset has two rules: all users have some affinity for Marketing OR Advertising content. Combining these two rulesets with the AND operator produces an audience that targets users with an email address that have some interest in either marketing or advertising. This audience could be used to email a special newsletter or promotion about a product or trending topic that is related to marketing or advertising.
Excluding Rule Sets
Rulesets, just like rules, can be excluded. Clicking ",28,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"the Include/Exclude toogle on the second ruleset will result in the audience targeting all users with an email address who do not have some interest in either marketing or advertising. It could be used to send a different email to the remainder of your users with email addresses.
Building Audiences: Configuration Options
Configure your Lytics audiences with the following options to execute your use cases.
Enabling API Access
By default, newly created Lytics audiences are not enabled for API access and thus will not be available to public APIs. Enabling API access is necessary when integrating with other client-side tags/ pixels, Pathfora, or the Lytics personalization API endpoints.
Select the API Accessible checkbox to enable access.
Generate Insights
Lytics Insights provide visibility into the performance of your audiences and campaigns as users interact with your brand. Insights are generated out-of-the-box for Lytics Behavioral and Engagement audiences. You can also request up to 1",29,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"0 custom audiences to be prioritized as candidates for generating Insights.
When creating a new audience or editing an existing one, select the Generate Insights checkbox to make that audience a candidate for Insights (shown in the screenshot above).
Lytics prioritizes Insights based on the statistical significance of the data and the most frequently used audiences for your account. Therefore, even if you select the ""Generate Insights"" option for a particular audience, it is not guaranteed to show up in your Insights drawer.
Managing Audiences
Managing audiences becomes important as an account develops and your user base grows. Audiences are critical to both targeted campaigns as well as discovering insights about your users.
The Audiences section of Lytics houses all of your account’s audiences. You can view, create, and manage audiences from this section.
Audiences are listed alphabetically by default. Click any column header to change the sort property. Common sort options are Last ",30,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"Modified and Size (the number of users in the audience).
Naming Your Audiences
For better targeting, Lytics encourages the creation of many audiences. They’re easy and free to make. When working with a large library of audiences, naming conventions become important.
Name your audiences by purpose and include any categorization in the name. Giving them a common prefix (e.g., Holiday Promo: Tech lovers, Holiday Promo: Loyal Shoppers) will help you to keep everything related next to each other in the user interface.
Audiences appear throughout the Lytics platform. Make sure your naming convention works in any context to avoid confusion.
Finding Audiences
The easiest way to find an audience is to use the Search box. As you enter your search term the audience list will display any matching audiences.
📘Fuzzy matching is used to search for audiences so the results will not be an exact match to the search term.
Editing Audiences
Occasionally you will want to return to previously created audien",31,docs_audiences.txt

Maintaining Audiences
📘From the Audiences page, click any audience in the list to view all of its details.
An audience's landing page contains a lot of valuable information about your users and the audience itself. At the top of the audience page, you will find the following information...
Audience name
ID
Slug
Created by
Created on date
Last updated date
API access configuration
Below this information you will find multiple tabs where you can access additional information about the audience.
Audience Summary
The audience summary page is designed to provide insights into the current state of an audience as well as how the audience has changed over time. When first navigating to an audience landing page, this tab will be selected by default.
The Summary tab includes the following sections:
General Metrics
The total number of users in this audience
The total percentage of this au",34,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"dience as compared to the total number of profiles in your account
The percentage change in audience size over the last 7 and last 30 days
Activity trend (graph of audience size over the defined date range)
Activity Graph
After creating a new audience, the audience size graph will begin to populate within a day. Depending on the date range you specify, the activity graph can be viewed using following intervals:
Hourly
Daily
Weekly
Monthly
Audience Size Trends
📘The statistics for audience size start from the creation date of the audience.
Keep in mind that audiences are real-time. This makes them quite different from the user lists in other marketing tools which are frozen in time and only change when you update the list. Audiences are filters applied to the total audience and will change whenever a user's behavior changes in a way that will add or remove them from the audience definition. In this way, tracking audience size over time is a powerful reporting tool.
For example, you creat",35,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"e an audience that contains users who have visited the international news section of your website. Upon creation the audience contains 120,000 users. You then run a marketing campaign promoting your international news section. After one week, the audience has grown from 120,000 to 400,000 users with most of the growth occurring in the 24 hours after the campaign was launched. This is clear evidence that the campaign was effective, and most effective in the first 24 hours, at driving users to your international news section.s
Audience Details
Select the Details tab to view the following sections:
Exports: This section outlines what exports (if any) are using this audience

Activating Audiences
Activating Audiences in Experiences
Creating a Lytics Experience is one of the easiest and most common ways to activate Lytics Audiences. Learn more about Lytics Experiences to find out how you can engage your audiences on site.
Accessing Audiences Using the Public Entity API
The Lytics Experience Editor is a great way to get started with website personalization, but through the use of the Lytics API, there is much more that can be done.
The Lytics Experience editor is powered by the Pathfora SDK which is in turn powered by the Lytics Entity API. The Lytics Entity API is how to find out what audiences the current user belongs to as well as what traits the user has. Using the Lytics Entity API it's possible to create completely custom personalized experiences on your site.
📘Personalizing ",37,docs_audiences.txt
lytics,Audiences,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/audiences,"a site using the Public Entity API requires making code changes to the host website.
To read more about the Entity API, check out the API documentation.
Exporting Audiences to Other Tools
A core benefit of Lytics is exporting your smart audiences to the other tools in your marketing tech stack. That way, the campaigns run on your channels are enriched with the behavioral data and content affinities powered by data science on Lytics.
From the audience overview page, click the Export button to create a new export job . The Export menu lists built in exports such as Email CSV and any out of the box Integrations. Specific instructions for exporting can be found in the Integrations section (under the desired tool) of our documentation.Updated 5 months ago Table of Contents

Clicking the + Create New button will open a wizard that will guide you through creating a new Template. The first step involves selecting a Name, Description, Data-Type, and Template-Type. The Data-Type allows you to select the type of data used by the Template,
either User or Event (the default option is User ). The Template-Type configures the type of templating language used by the Template, either Jsonnet or Handlebars.js.
After clicking Next, you will be guided to the Template configuration page where you must first select the type of Sample Data used by the Template. If the User data-type was selected, you will see a dummy user comprised of all of the fields in the user schema, or the option to search for a user.

Once the Sample Data has been selected, Step 2 involves specifying your desired JSON structure for your destination in the Template Co-Pilot text box. Consider the example below where we specify the structure of our JSON payload, with fields such as _uid, last_active_ts, last_name, and pillowcase_affinity(derived from the lytics_content field). We are also using the Find a User feature to populate the Sample Data. Note: this example is using the Additional Prompt text box to assist the Co-Pilot in generating the template. Here we are instructing the Co-Pilot to use the lytics_content field to derive the pillowcase_affinity template field.
Once Generate Template has been clicked, the text box in (3) will populate with the template. With the previous example, the following template has been generated:

In the example below, you can see how merge stats can be used to uncover potential areas of issue. Out of the four available identifiers, user_id, is not responsible for any merges.

Vault is a centralized hub for managing security and other administrative features in Lytics. It provides a single place for Lytics admins to access and change their key security features and user permissions, regardless of product. This means that the controls set in Vault apply to Conductor, Decision Engine, Cloud Connect, and any other products associated with your Lytics account.
Take a quick tour of Lytics Vault.
Navigating Vault
Vault is comprised of the following sections:
Account Usage - an overview of your general account quota usage related to event consumption.
Account Settings - view and change necessary administrative settings and details of your account. These are sectioned into the following categories.
Account Details
JavaScript Tag
Lytics API

Users - view a list of users accessing your Lytics acc",6,docs_what-is-vault.txt
lytics,What is Vault?,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/what-is-vault,"ount, change their details or permissions, remove a user, or invite a new user to the account.
Security
Access Tokens - view and manage a list of Lytics API access tokens. New tokens can be provisioned with specific permissions.
Authorizations - create, edit, view, and delete authorizations within Lytics. Authorizations are credentials to third parties that enable the necessary scopes and permissions for data import and export jobs to run.
Account Setup
JavaScript Tag - learn how to install the Lytics JavaScript tag and validate the installation.
Who can access Vault?
Vault is focused primarily on account admins or those that have permission to administer settings, user access, etc. Based upon these permissions, your experience in Vault may vary, and all sections outlined above may not be available.
📘If you are unable to access a section please reach out to your account administrator to request those adjusted permissions.
In general, Admins will be able to access all areas. Data Manage",7,docs_what-is-vault.txt
lytics,What is Vault?,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/what-is-vault,"rs, Campaign Managers, Experience Managers, and Goal Managers can access the Authorizations section to manage the credentials for their jobs and experiences. Finally, all Lytics users, regardless of role, should have access to view the JavaScript tag installation page under Account Setup, and they should be able to view their user profile where they can change details such as their Name, Email Address, Phone Number (for two-factor authentication) and change their password. Your user profile will be accessible under the main Lytics navigation under ""Manage My Profile.""
Notable Changes
For existing customers, slight changes will impact your day-to-day management activities.
Product Switcher
Vault will be available directly from the primary product switcher at the top left of your Lytics interface. This will be your primary access point for account management from now on.
Account Usage
Our account usage data and quota meters received a much-needed facelift. The usage metrics act as the Va",8,docs_what-is-vault.txt
lytics,What is Vault?,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/what-is-vault,"ult ""dashboard"" for admin users.
Account Settings
Account setting sections are now accessible through the main navigation. These settings have received a minor facelift update. The form controls for multi-text fields have been slightly updated for a more standard user experience. In addition, users are now prompted to save or discard their changes when navigating away from these pages with unsaved settings.
Users
The user list is now sortable and filterable based on name, email, who invited them, and how long they've been a Lytics user. Each user has a page to view their details and roles. In Vault, in addition to assigning new roles, an administrator can edit any user's name and email address.
The user invite form is now on its page to improve the flow and experience of inviting users. Roles are now sorted into two categories - Admin or Custom Roles. An admin inherently has access to everything, while custom roles give a finer-grain definition of what the user can access. The details ",9,docs_what-is-vault.txt
lytics,What is Vault?,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/what-is-vault,"on each role are shown in a tooltip when you hover over the role name.
Access Tokens
The access tokens list is now sortable and filterable based on the name, description, the creator of the token, or when/if it has expired. You can now view additional details about the access tokens you've already created, such as the roles assigned, when it was made, and when it will expire. In addition, new access tokens can now be assigned as an admin or with any combination of more granular access roles.
Authorizations
Authorizations are now to be created and updated only in Vault. You will still be able to utilize the auths you create in Vault in other products, but for example, when creating a job in Conductor or Decision Engine, if you don't see an authorization you want to use for that job, you will be linked into the authorizations wizard within Vault to create the auth.

Please note, that this is not an exhaustive list of scenarios, the following should be considered a guideline.
Community - Lytics has a community section on their docs site where users of Lytics can ask general questions about Lytics, how to use Lytics, and what’s possible with Lytics. Think of this community area as your Lytics Stackoverflow. The Lytics Community can be found here.
Some examples of community-type questions are:
“Regarding the NLP engine, are you able to scrape all the contents of, apply topics to, and associate topic scores to users on PDFs?”
“Can one set up alerts for jobs failing and/or being deleted like you can set up alerts ",6,docs_lytics-communication.txt
lytics,Lytics Communication,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lytics-communication,"for event overages?”
“Is there an endpoint I can hit to see hidden streams?”
Customer-specific questions or questions that regard Solution Architecture (complex) for a customer are not suitable for the Community section and should be asked in Zendesk.
Zendesk - All customers and partners working on behalf of customers can use the Lytics Support Portal for the following:
Report technical issues with the Lytics platform, e.g. Bug reports
Feature Requests
Solution architecture questions that require discretion with customer needs
Assistance with features that may not be accessible by a partner or customer
Partners can contact the Lytics support team through support.lytics.com or [email protected], which will create a Zendesk ticket.
Slack & Email - Partners are encouraged to communicate directly with the Lytics team for other partnership needs. Please prioritize Community and Zendesk for any customer CDP-related questions.
Some examples of Email and Slack communications are:

This document outlines how to leverage Lytics' real-time personalization engine to identify visitors who lack the strong identifiers necessary to link web-based behavioral insights with other activation channels such as email.
Background
What is lead capture?
Traditionally, lead capture involves gathering information from individuals interested in your products or services, such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. This occurs when people visit your website, subscribe to your newsletter, download resources, or interact with your content. However, in recent years, the role of lead capture within your global consumer engagement strategy has undergone significant transformation.
Why is it important?
Accurate measurement of attribution and conversions is paramount to assessing the effectiveness of your marketing efforts.
With the challenges pos",6,docs_lead-capture.txt
lytics,Lead Capture,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lead-capture,"ed by the deprecation of third-party cookies, particularly impacting top-of-funnel ad campaigns, lead capture becomes a crucial data collection and targeting strategy.
In an era of short attention spans, every interaction must be hyper-relevant and efficient, making lead capture instrumental in delivering personalized content.
As marketing budgets face constraints, each dollar spent must yield maximum potential, and lead capture aids in optimizing resource allocation.
Building comprehensive consumer profiles representing behavioral patterns over time is essential to get the most out of the latest advancements in AI.
See it in action.
Lytics' real-time personalization engine lets you first identify the current web visitor, programmatically review their profile, and ultimately decide if a campaign should be delivered to their browser to close gaps in that profile.
Instructions
Below, you'll find a detailed guide on how to execute this use case. At the end, you'll find additional reading,",7,docs_lead-capture.txt
lytics,Lead Capture,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lead-capture," which will help you learn how to extend and customize this use case further.
Requirements
Have access to an active Lytics account.
Ability to add JavaScript to your website via tag manager or CMS.
Entry-level knowledge of JavaScript. (Don't worry; it is mostly ""copy and paste"" here.)
Install Lytics Core SDK
Before executing this use case, your website must be properly configured with the core Lytics SDK (JavaScript tag). Please refer to our installation documentation to confirm the tag is present before continuing.
Activate Required Attributes
As an admin user of Lytics, you can enable or disable any attributes from being surfaced to the web via our JavaScript SDK. Depending on how your account has been configured, you may need to allow some of the required attributes for this particular use case.
Required Attributes:
Attributeanonymous_profilesThis computed attribute, available by default in all accounts, represents visitors who do not yet have a strong identifier, such as an email a",8,docs_lead-capture.txt
lytics,Lead Capture,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lead-capture,"ddress.known_profilesThis computed attribute, available by default in all accounts, represents visitors with strong identifiers such as email addresses.
Configure Web Experience
To execute this use case, we will launch a simple lead capture form at the bottom left of your site. The lead capture will focus on collecting email addresses for the user and use a generic ""dark"" theme along with some boilerplate messaging. For best results, we recommend leveraging an offer of some sort that will resonate with your customers to entice them to ""sign up"" and identify themselves. In return, you'll gain much knowledge about this visitor, strengthen your consumer record, and unlock the ability to connect in channels outside of just the web.
JavaScript<script type=""text/javascript"">
jstag.on('pathfora.publish.done', function(topic, event){
var module = new pathfora.Form({
id: 'lead-capture-form',
layout: 'slideout',
theme: 'dark',
headline: 'Sign up!',
msg: 'Submit this form to get updates',

lytics,Lead Capture,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lead-capture,"ments: [
{
""type"": ""email"",
""required"": true,
""label"": ""Email"",
""name"": ""email""
}
]
});
var modules = {
target: [{
segment: ""anonymous_profiles"",
widgets: [module]
}]
};
pathfora.initializeWidgets(modules);
});
</script>
Bonus Idea
You can extend this use case to progressively improve your visitor profiles by surfacing data capture forms specific to gaps in their profile data. For instance, when they are unknown, only ask for email. As soon as you have an email, perhaps you want to know more about their preferences or learn how to improve a particular portion of your product/offering.
Configure Reporting
The Lytics platform has a pre-defined schema to facilitate this use case. As such, we recommend building a custom report from within our UI to showcase your progress in converting unknown or anonymous visitors to known visitors with a strong identifier. There are many ways to configure this type of reporting, but here we'll guide you through a basic example to measure impact.
Create Ne",10,docs_lead-capture.txt
lytics,Lead Capture,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lead-capture,"w Report
Add Anonymous vs. Known ""Size"" Component
Step 1: Once you have created your new report, add a component using the ""+ Add New Component"" button at the top of the report.
Step 2: Select ""Size"" as your component type.
Step 3: Name your component. We recommend something simple like ""Anonymous vs. Known"".
Step 4: Add an optional description to explain the goal of this report to ease the consumption for others later.
Step 5: Select the audiences you'd like to highlight. In this use case, we'll select ""Anonymous Profiles"" and ""Known Profiles"", which are both available by default.
Step 6: Save your component. Please note it may take some time for the report to populate once you have configured it, but as long as you see the empty ""Not enough data"" state, you are good to go.
Add Impression ""Composition"" Component
Step 1: Following steps similar to the previous component, we'll add another component, but this time, we use the ""Composition"" component type.
Step 2: Name your component ""Ca",11,docs_lead-capture.txt
lytics,Lead Capture,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lead-capture,"mpaign Impressions,"" as this component will focus on showcasing impression information to validate that the campaign is being shown.
Step 3: Select the ""All"" audience to ensure all visitors, regardless if they are known or unknown, are included in the report.
Step 4: Select the field ""ly_impressions."" This field represents an array of all campaigns each visitor has interacted with and is available by default. The values returned for custom campaigns will match the ""ID"" you set above in the campaign configuration.
Step 5: Finally, replace ""my_campaign_id"" in the example below with the ID of your campaign above to highlight only interactions for that campaign.
Add Conversion ""Composition"" Component
Following the same steps as above, configure another ""Composition"" component, but this time, use the field ""ly_conversions"" as it will be an array of all campaigns your users have converted on instead of the impressions used previously.
Thats it. Your report has been configured. As you begin t",12,docs_lead-capture.txt
lytics,Lead Capture,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lead-capture,"o gain impressions and conversions, this report will populate. Generally, every hour or two, to highlight the impact.

Execute Your Experience
Once you have configured and tested your Experience, activation is as simple as publishing the JavaScript code to your site. This may be done via a tag manager like Google Tag Manager or using another mechanism such as Drupal blocks or WordPress.Updated 12 months ago Table of Contents

Identity Resolution is a crucial component of customer communication. Establishing and maintaining a well-defined identity resolution strategy is essential, but it can be overwhelming to get started. Several challenges may arise, such as limited and outdated customer data, data silos, technical difficulties, in-flexibility, consistency, compliance, and maintenance.
Lytics offers a solution that powers brands' identity resolution strategies by aggregating data from disparate sources, defining a standardized customer schema, unifying disparate sources, surfacing individual consumer profiles, enabling better understanding, segmentation, and activation across channel tools, ensuring control, visibility, flexibility, security, privacy, and compliance, and maximizing match rates and accuracy across activation channels.
The goal",6,docs_identity-resolution.txt
lytics,Identity Resolution,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/identity-resolution," is to construct complex consumer profiles and maintain accurate and compliant user profiles as your brand evolves. Defining the relationship between consumer identifiers is a necessary first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements. To achieve this, we've broken our approach into three components:
Our Approach
Define: Relationships Between Identifiers
Profile definition is the first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements.
To build a strong identity resolution strategy, three key questions must be answered:
How important is accuracy?
How do you define and manage the strength of each identifier to ensure profiles are materialized properly?
How can the materialized profiles be analyzed and delivered to other tools?
Construct: Complex Profiles
Data is messy. Lytics' Profil",7,docs_identity-resolution.txt
lytics,Identity Resolution,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/identity-resolution,"e Materialization provides a necessary cleansing & polishing layer atop the defined resolution strategy. This ensures what is surfaced is accurate and accessible and enables your team to accelerate impact.
Answering the following two key questions guarantee profiles represent the ideal marketable entity:
What attributes should be surfaced on profiles for segmentation, and does the data need to be normalized at all?
What rules should be used to maintain profile integrity?
Maintain: Accurate & Compliant Profiles
Over time profiles will bloat, attributes will become stale, and use cases become more complex. If unmanaged, a quality identity strategy will begin breaking down the moment it is implemented.
Lytics prevents your identity strategy from breakdown through a set of powerful tools focused on ensuring the following profile health-related questions have concrete answers:
How can you validate the health of your ID resolution strategy over time?
What is the process for managing consent?",8,docs_identity-resolution.txt
lytics,Identity Resolution,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/identity-resolution,"
How long is a profile relevant if it no longer has a means of being updated?
What is the life expectancy of expirable IDs, such as browser cookies?
Advanced Concepts
The Lytics Identity Graph
Behind each Lytics profile is an identity graph.
This graph represents connections between pieces of data observed across multiple sources or even within a single source.
To create (or update) profiles from a data stream, the stream must contain one or more identity keys that identify distinct users with which to associate the data.
When data is observed for a given identity key, it stores the relevant profile metadata in an object called an identity fragment.
When there's evidence on a data stream
that two keys or fragments should be connected
When evidence on a data stream shows that two keys or fragments identify the same real-world entity, those fragments become connected in the same identity graph.
Some identity graphs are significant and represent complex relationships in the data. In contr",9,docs_identity-resolution.txt
lytics,Identity Resolution,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/identity-resolution,"ast, other identity graphs are small and describe a small interaction, like an anonymous cookie from a single-visit, incognito browser.
Graph Mechanics
As you learned from the identity resolution overview, a profile comprises one or more identity fragments.
Many profiles start as singletons – new data is observed on a data stream. That event's identifier keys create any necessary identity fragments and store the event's associated data on that fragment.
However, we're not satisfied with several singletons – our objective is to stitch data sources together by linking the appropriate underlying fragments.
Stitching occurs when we observe two identifiers in a single event.
A common stitching event is a newsletter signup, where the email address from the newsletter form is linked to the cookie from their web activity and creates a link between activity from the browser on the device and any activity associated with the email address, which could eventually encompass purchases, support tick",10,docs_identity-resolution.txt
lytics,Identity Resolution,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/identity-resolution,"ets, CRM data, etc.
In graph terms, stitching creates an edge between two nodes representing two identity fragments.
If we wanted to retrieve a profile associated with an email address, we would retrieve all of the fragments with edges or connections to other fragments.
From there, we'd want to find all of the connections to those other fragments, and so on, until there are no more connections to follow.
Following one fragment to another is called traversal.
The full set of fragments that are found to have connections to the initial fragment are called neighbors.
In Lytics, default graph limits cap the number of traversals allowed for an individual profile at 50 and cap the number of neighbors allowed at 50.
Changing these values can create different sets of user profiles over the same data set and should not be adjusted lightly.
To change these values for your data, please contact Lytics support.
Identity Keys
As we traverse identity graphs, we'll quickly find that identity fragments ",11,docs_identity-resolution.txt
lytics,Identity Resolution,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/identity-resolution,"and their corresponding identity keys are not all created equal. An identifier's strength must contribute proportionally to its influence on identity resolution.
For example, you have email addresses and cookies as identity keys.
Generally, a user identified with an email address can have multiple cookie values (from different devices, browsers, periods, etc.).
Imagine hosting a promotional, in-person event and having multiple tablets collecting participants' email addresses.
Depending on how those email addresses are collected (most likely through an online form), you'll likely have one cookie associated with many email addresses.
Field Types
Field types for Identity Keys can be either a string or a string set.
String sets are a common field type for cookies since one profile is expected to have many cookie values over time.
Email addresses are not so cut-and-dry.
Some organizations will constrain profiles to have one email address, while others will allow profiles to have multiple (p",12,docs_identity-resolution.txt
lytics,Identity Resolution,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/identity-resolution,"ersonal, work, etc.).
In our example of email collection via physical tablet, if the email address is a single-valued string type, we won't end up with an over-merged hairball.
Using an identity key that allows for a set of values is usually a good idea to have a sensical capacity cap on the field type.
A set of cookies, for example, might have a capacity limit of 50 values.
On the other hand, a set of emails might have a capacity limit of 5 values.
Identity Key Rankings
The ranking of your identity keys should reflect their reliability and their relative importance in the strategy.
In the event of a conflict in stitching and merging, higher-ranked identity keys will win.
Typically, most Lytics users configure email identifiers to be ranked higher than cookie identifiers.
Imagine a scenario where email A is connected to cookies X and Y, while email B is connected to cookie Z.
If new data is observed that connects email B with cookie Y, we have a conflict, meaning that a resulting stitc",13,docs_identity-resolution.txt
lytics,Identity Resolution,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/identity-resolution,"hing between the two fragments would yield a profile with two different email fragments and violates our merge rules.
The ranks of identity keys would dictate that, for the new event, the email address it contains is of a higher priority than the cookie value that it contains and would consequently update the profile for Email A and not the profile for Email B.
Graph Compaction
We mentioned that a critical tenet of bulletproof identity resolution is that profile complexity remains stable over time.
That is, we need a way to ensure that a relatively greedy algorithm doesn't result in profiles becoming more fragile and susceptible to conflicts.
In Lytics, that is accomplished via graph compaction, a process by which data from multiple fragments is combined into a single fragment.
Doing so allows well-established relationships in the graph to be solidified while making room for new relationships within the profile.
It functions more as a type of profile housekeeping to keep profile fragme",14,docs_identity-resolution.txt
lytics,Identity Resolution,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/identity-resolution,"nts tidy.
Compaction in identity graphs can take on a few forms.
Rank-based Compaction
Let's go back to our example with Email A and Email B.
The point of identity resolution within a customer data platform is to enable long and rich relationships with customers.
The longer that Email A and Email B represent profiles in the platform, the more cookies with which they'll eventually become connected.
Each identity key's ranking allows an identity graph to compact by size or time.
Size compaction: Identity key sets can be compacted after they reach a configurable size.
If size compaction is enabled to compact a set after 30 values, then the data from the oldest 30 fragments would be combined into a single fragment and would be further compacted with new data as new values are observed.
Time compaction: These sets would be compacted after a configurable time threshold.
If time compaction is enabled to compact a set after 14 days, then the data from fragments older than 14 days would be comp",15,docs_identity-resolution.txt

lytics,Template Examples,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/template-examples," Message CampaignRecommend Content CampaignCampaign ReportingCampaign ManagementBuilding Audiences with Campaign DataTemplate Examples Suggest EditsSimple webhook payloads
One of the primary use-cases for templates is for shaping the request payload for outgoing Webhook Exports from Lytics. For example, say you are exporting a Lytics audience called frequent_visitors to a service that expects the following JSON in the request body:
JSON{
""first_name"": ""Bob"",
""last_name"": ""Smith"",
""email_address"": ""[email protected]"",
""marketing_list"": ""frequent_visitors""
}
We could create the following template in Lytics, and select it in our Webhook Export job configuration to send the correct request, using the first_name, last_name, and email fields on your Lytics profiles (see here for details on using the lytemplates.libsonnet library):
jsonnetlocal event = (import 'lytemplates.libsonnet');
{
first_name: event.get(""first_name"", """")
last_name:
event.get(""last_name"", """"),
email_address: event.get(""e",6,docs_template-examples.txt
lytics,Template Examples,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/template-examples,"mail"", """"),
marketing_list: event.segSlug()
}
Once created, this template can be selected from the Lytics Template dropdown menu in the webhook job configuration.
Using assert to skip events that have empty required fields
Many times when sending webhook events, certain fields must be set or the webhook endpoint will respond with an HTTP error, causing the webhook job to fail.
This simple template uses the jsonnet assert function to signal that email must be set before sending. These events will be omitted from sending and will be logged with the included assertion message email must be set.
jsonnetlocal event = (import ""lytemplates.libsonnet"");
local email() =
local email = event.get(""email"", """");
assert email != """" : 'email must be set';
email;
{
""email"": email()
}
Using templates for dynamic URLs
You can also use a template to dynamically generate URLs for webhook requests instead of hard-coding one in your job configuration. Say you are exporting Lytics profiles to a service that e",7,docs_template-examples.txt
lytics,Template Examples,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/template-examples,"xpects requests to the following endpoint where {email} is the user's email address:

Google Ads Customer Match
When setting up an export to Google Ads Customer Match, there are two dropdowns where you can set the given consent for the audience being exported: Ad User Data Consent
and Personalization Data Consent.
For Ad User Data Consent, there are three separate options. Setting to Granted notifies Google Ads that everyone in the audience has provided consent to send user data to Google for advertising purposes.
For Personalization Consent there are the same three options. Setting to Granted notifies Google Ads that everyone in the audience has provided consent for personalized advertising.

Google DV360
When setting up an audience export to Google DV360, you must check the User Consent Confirmed checkbox to confirm that you have collected all required consent for the exported audience.
If you have an ongoing audience export to Google DV360, those that haven't confirmed that user consent was granted will go into a failed state. For these jobs, if in fact you have confirmed consent, then you can edit the job, check the User Consent Confirmed checkbox and hit Complete. Once saved, you can select to retry the job and the export will update DV360 list with the consent confirmation, fulfilling the user consent requirements.

When setting up export of cookies or emails to Amazon DSP, you will be asked to select all the countries where the user info was collected in the Country Codes input.
Amazon DSP uses the source countries of your audience to prevent DMA requirements from being applied to out-of-scope countries such as UK, IN, US, JP etc.
Amazon will treat any audience without a country code as in-scope for DMA. Please note that if no country codes are selected, your export is likely to report a 0% match rate.
If you have an ongoing audience export to Amazon DSP, you can edit the job in Lytics, select the country codes that apply, and hit Complete. Lytics will then update the audience definition in Amazon DSP.

User profiles provide relevant insights about individual customers in relation to your entire customer base. Referencing a user profile helps answer questions about who your customers are and how they are engaging with your brand.
Initially, the user profile offers a way to test your Lytics implementation and validate the outcomes of your marketing tactics. For example, you can check if campaigns are working as expected by using a “test” persona and seeing how the user profile data gets updated.
As you get deeper into building campaigns, the user profile provides insight into how your marketing influences user behaviors. For example, if you run a mobile campaign, you can drill down to see if customers are engaging on mobile devices, what days and times they are most active, and what types of content they are affinity for. User profiles are",6,docs_understanding-user-profiles.txt
lytics,User Profiles,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/understanding-user-profiles," updated in real-time, but there can be a delay while the data is being processed and scores are being calculated for behavior and content affinity.
To provide quick access to customer data, the user profile is divided into three tabs: Intelligence, Audiences, and Details.
Anatomy of a User Profile
Intelligence
The intelligence tab gives a snapshot of key information about an individual user. At the top, a bar is displayed to help you quickly understand user engagement across all channels: Likelihood to re-engage, Current engagement level, and Frequency of user interactions.
Each of these boxes summarizes the data science-powered behavioral scores into practical terms. The individual behavior scores and the user’s content affinity are displayed below. This rich data based on a user’s actual behavior is available thanks to the predictive analytics built into Lytics.
Recent activity by channel
This module gives an overview of which channels (email, web, mobile, etc.) an individual user h",7,docs_understanding-user-profiles.txt
lytics,User Profiles,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/understanding-user-profiles,"as been active in. When appropriately mapped, it will also provide information on when users were active on each channel (within the last day or within the last 30 days).
NOTE: If this module is empty, please see below for details on how to configure the user fields. As with all data mapping exercises, it is best to include your Customer Success representatives for optimal results.
How the recent activity by channel is managed
If you are customizing LQL or handling custom streams, it is important to understand how this module should be configured. For all our built-in integrations, Lytics includes this data mapping by default.
At its core, the ""Recent activity by channel"" module is built from a single user field. This field will not exist in legacy accounts and must be added to the existing LQL manually. For all new accounts that get the latest default LQL files, the baseline should be included.
In order to handle either custom data mapping for an account or backfill an old account, th",8,docs_understanding-user-profiles.txt
lytics,User Profiles,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/understanding-user-profiles,"e user field last_channel_activities must be defined in a streams LQL file. This field is defined as a map[string]time and should not be altered.
In each stream you'll simply map a string, such as ""web"" or ""email"" to a timestamp such as epochms() in order to update the field. A more lengthy example for an email LQL might look something like:
-- Profile Support
map(""email"", epochms())
AS last_channel_activities
IF eq(tolower(action), ""open"") OR eq(tolower(action), ""click"")
SHORTDESC ""Last Activity By Channel""
KIND map[string]time
The example above is for when you only want to map the activity event in the case of a click or open. This definition will vary from stream to stream.
When it comes to which keys to use, we recommend following these standards for common channels:
email
ad
web
mobile
support
Unique identifiers

lytics,User Profiles,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/understanding-user-profiles,"ek. The top right of the chart highlights when a user is most active, for example Tuesdays at 10am.
Audience Membership
This tab displays a list of all the current Audiences a user belongs to and the total size of each audience. Audiences include factual information such as “Has Email Address” and “Known Location” along with Lytics score-driven characteristics such as “Deeply Engaged” or “Binge User”.
Profile Details
The details tab gives an under-the-hood display of the exact user fields contributing to a user’s behavioral data and their audiences. Unique identifiers are shown first, which are essential for enabling cross-channel mapping. For all user fields, the associated stream and value is provided.
Profile Picture
Some profiles may include a profile picture when viewed in the user interface. This image comes from Gravatar. If the profile in question has an email address, Lytics converts it to an MD5 hash. That hash is then used to look up the corresponding image on Gravatar. This",10,docs_understanding-user-profiles.txt

When data is brought into Lytics, it organizes diverse data structures and tables to accommodate the customer's evolving data activation requirements. This document will delve into the various data storage methods employed by Lytics and explain the purpose, access, and behavior of these different storage structures.
The Lytics' Graph
The system records each unique identifier (ID) as separate nodes within the graph structure. A collection of nodes linked by edges corresponds to a singular profile. The data associated with the most robust ID present in an incoming event is stored. While not directly accessible via the API, this information is made available through the ""Identity"" tab in the conductor. The graph undergoes immediate updates upon the arrival of new events. General",6,docs_lytics-platform-data-flow-and-access.txt
lytics,Lytics Platform Data Flow and Access,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lytics-platform-data-flow-and-access,"ly, the response time from a graph update to the corresponding entity ranges from milliseconds to seconds.
Graph view of consumer profiles in Conductor
Raw Data Store
The system efficiently stores every event received from Lytics, both in batch and real-time modes. Each event includes a timestamp indicating when the event took place and when it entered the Lytics system. Although this information is not directly accessible through the API or user interface (UI), it is possible to transmit the events downstream using our out-of-the-box (OOTB) integrations, such as the BigQuery (BQ) export feature. This scenario seamlessly transfers the events from the raw storage to designated downstream tables. These operations can be initiated or concluded at any given time. The raw storage option also serves as a valuable resource for replaying data in the event of corrupted or malformed data, ensuring data integrity throughout the account.

The system diligently maintains and stores th",7,docs_lytics-platform-data-flow-and-access.txt
lytics,Lytics Platform Data Flow and Access,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lytics-platform-data-flow-and-access,"e latest Lytics profiles, ensuring their accuracy and relevance. These profiles encompass various attributes, such as scores and segment memberships. Users can conveniently access these profiles through the user interface (UI) using the Decision Engine functionality. Additionally, the profiles can be retrieved programmatically via the API, utilizing any of the existing profile IDs.
To facilitate this process, you can reference the profile's URL in the UI, which contains the necessary ID value for API access.
📘URL Example : https://app.lytics.com/entity/user/_uids/[ProfileID]?aid=[AID]&view=details
The transition from data entry to the updated entity is typically swift, with response times ranging from milliseconds to seconds. The updated entity is a valuable resource for real-time activations, including trigger-based exports, membership in client-side experiences or audiences, and client-side attribute updates. These functionalities enable seamless and immediate user interactions based",8,docs_lytics-platform-data-flow-and-access.txt
lytics,Lytics Platform Data Flow and Access,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lytics-platform-data-flow-and-access," on their up-to-date profiles.

Segmentation
The system securely stores and maintains up-to-date Lytics Audiences, encompassing profiles and their membership within these audiences. The system employs indexes on profile attributes to facilitate efficient retrieval and modifications, enabling fast access to the desired data. Users can conveniently access and interact with the audiences through the user interface (UI) using the Decision Engine feature. Alternatively, audiences can be accessed programmatically via the API, providing flexibility for data retrieval in a one-to-many fashion.
Audiences can be created through Lytics Segment API using Segment QL, offering a powerful tool for audience customization. When referencing audiences in the UI, the Segment ID can be found within the URL, aiding API-based operations.
📘URL Example: https://app.lytics.com/audiences/[SegmentID]summary?aid=AID
As the last table to be updated after an event, ",9,docs_lytics-platform-data-flow-and-access.txt
lytics,Lytics Platform Data Flow and Access,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lytics-platform-data-flow-and-access,"the audience table exhibits a slightly longer update time compared to other components. However, since this table is not involved in real-time processes, it does not impact latency or affect the responsiveness of other functionalities.
Note: To allow the system indexes on profile attributes, the creation of new fields will need to be added to this index first, creating an additional delay before new fields will be visible in the audience builder.
The Segment feature is vital in several aspects, including audience creation, populating the field information tab, and facilitating batch exports. It is a fundamental building block for audience segmentation and targeted campaigns within the Lytics platform.

Content curation on Lytics involves scanning your website and other content to ingest topics and build content affinities. Properly setting up the curation process is key to enabling use cases such as promoting relevant ads and delivering targeted web content.
This document gives an overview of important concepts and considerations to make while curating your content during the early stages of implementation. It will also help determine if any custom content curation should be planned for.
Ensure that any content customization is performed to support your campaign execution and audience building, not for the sake of customization itself.
Overview
Once the Lytics JavaScript tag is installed, Lytics automatically begins crawling the content on your website using Natural Language Processing (NLP) engines. Put simply, this means t",6,docs_content-curation.txt
lytics,Content Curation,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/content-curation,"hat:
Lytics will index your content producing a list of all your content. By default, content includes your web pages and images.
Lytics will crawl the content via NLP providers (such as Google NLP or Diffbot, and extract topics associated with that content.
Over time, as users interact with your content, Lytics identifies user content affinity levels for various topics. While this functionality begins working right away without you having to do anything, there are various things to consider to ensure Lytics is bringing in the content you’ll need to execute use cases.
What domains should Lytics scan?
By default, Lytics will scan all content on your domains. You can specify which domains Lytics will scan by adding domains to the ""Domain Allowlist"", which can be modified by navigating to Account Settings > Content.
If there are only certain sections of your website Lytics should be scanning, you can customize by allowing or blocking specific paths as well. For example, if you have a blog",7,docs_content-curation.txt
lytics,Content Curation,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/content-curation," section and other pages won’t be relevant to gauge what users are interested in, you can add the path /blog/ to the list of allowed paths.
You can see which domains have been improved in the domain and path settings on the Content Classification page. Visit the content account settings documentation for detailed instructions on how to add more domains or paths.
Are there any paths that should be avoided?
A website may have sections that should not be scanned for topics such as password reset pages or any pages hidden behind a log-in (e.g. /password-reset/ or /admin/). These paths can be blocked in your Account Settings under Content.
Which NLP service should I be using?
Lytics uses Google NLP which pulls from their knowledge graph/taxonomy. If you determine you're not getting enough topics from your content, Lytics can use Diffbot in addition to Google NLP, which has more loose associations between topics and content. You'll bring in more topics, but may be slightly surprised by what ",8,docs_content-curation.txt
lytics,Content Curation,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/content-curation,"you see!
If your brand is international, you may need to consider which languages are supported by each NLP service. Please consult the provider documentation for a list of languages supported by Google NLP and Diffbot. Another option is to turn NLP completely off and use only custom topics.
For more details on each service Lytics uses, see NLP services.
Backlog
If you aren’t seeing the content you expected to, note it may take some time for Lytics to crawl all of your content. By default, monthly limits exist for scanning new content (see Content Enrichment limits below). If Lytics scans all new content without having reached the limit, Lytics will move on to older content until it is all scanned. Please allow time for this.
Also, consider how far back should Lytics be scanning. For example, it is likely unnecessary to scan content from 2 years ago. If people are no longer interacting with that content, use Account Settings to set a date to start the scan from.
Content Enrichment limi",9,docs_content-curation.txt
lytics,Content Curation,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/content-curation,"ts
Lytics will scan and enrich up to 20,000 URLs per month by default. This limit is designed to act as a guard rail to ensure good filter hygiene is in place. Most accounts do not publish close to 20,000 pieces of distinct content per month. If you believe your account is hitting this limit, please check with your Lytics Implementation team. Once confirmed, you can consider the following options:
Are there any domains or content paths that you can block? This will likely be part of the solution. See Are there any paths that should be avoided? above for more information.
Do you need Lytics to increase the limit?
Robot directives
Your domain likely has a robot directive (e.g. domain.com/robots.txt) that provides instructions to crawlers on how to crawl or index your content. Lytics will follow these directives. While typically not an issue, it’s worth turning to your directives when troubleshooting any missing content or information.
Metadata
You may want to build a collection of conten",10,docs_content-curation.txt
lytics,Content Curation,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/content-curation,"t based on publish date or author. Consider the following if this is the case:
If you have metadata on your website, is it using OpenGraph? Open Graph tags will populate the following default values in Lytics:
title, image, published_time, description, and lytics:topics. You can check the lytics_content query in your account to check if all the Open Graph tags you need are being picked up.
If you are not using Open Graph, Lytics may not be picking up any meta tags automatically. The quickest way to check that Lytics is bringing is to use our find a document tool to view the data Lytics has for a specific piece of content. Navigate to Content > Find a Document and search for the URL of the piece of content you would like to view.
If you make changes to your content's metadata and would like to preview those changes you can use our manual classification tool located at the bottom of the Content > Classification dashboard. Enter the URL with the updated metadata and click Get Details. Lyt",11,docs_content-curation.txt
lytics,Content Curation,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/content-curation,"ics will scan the document and display a preview of the updated metadata. If you are satisfied with the changes click Complete Classification. If not, you can make additional edits and preview again.
Alternatively, you can check by navigating to Content > Collections. Try to build content collections by author or publish date as these are the most commonly used filters. If the content doesn’t come up as expected, you may need to curate your tags.
Custom topics
For many users outside of publishing who may not have rich content, NLP derived topics aren’t enough. To accommodate this, Lytics can add custom topics via the metadata. The easiest way to do this is by adding the lytics:topics meta tag. Read more on providing custom topics.
If you already have topics in your metadata using a different meta tag than the above, it’s possible Lytics may be able to bring those in as well by making a change to your account settings. Speak with your implementation team about this.
Once this setting is",12,docs_content-curation.txt
lytics,Content Curation,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/content-curation," changed and content is rescanned, you will be able to build content collections with this topic, and users' affinities will be generated for these new topics.
Total number of topics
In the Lytics UI, you will see a max of 500 topics. Lytics keeps all of your topics, but only the top 500 are surfaced in the UI.
As you block topics, Lytics will backfill to show 500.
You can allow specific topics to ensure that they make the top 500.
If you choose to allow topics, make sure that the topics actually exist - either as custom topics or are being generated by NLP. Case sensitivity is important when adding topics to the allow list. For example, allowing ABBA is different than allowing Abba.
Other content
If you have other content on your site outside of web pages or images (e.g. PDFs) that you’d like to derive topics from and have them generate affinities, Lytics will need to develop a plan to bring those in using our APIs.
Document properties
All topics - NLP derived or custom topics - will ",13,docs_content-curation.txt
lytics,Content Curation,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/content-curation,"allow for two things:
Building a content collection with the topics.
Assign affinities to users for those topics.
There are instances where you may want to build collections based on a topic, but not have them generate affinities. For example, a collection of featured sale items, SKUs, genres, etc. You can set these as document properties in your metadata to allow for this.Updated 12 months ago Table of Contents

In Lytics, audit logs and system alerts originate from a shared source: Lytics System Events. A System Event is simply a log of an action taken within the platform, whether it’s a user creating a job, segment, or role, or an error message indicating a job failure.
Export vs. Alert
Log Export: This is a job that either streams logs in real time or performs a batch export to an external source, such as a webhook or a data warehouse table.
Log Alert: Alerts are triggered based on specified conditions and notify users when certain actions occur within the system.
In both cases, the content of exports or alerts depends on the filters you set up. Filtering is typically done using the Subject (such as User, Segment, or Job) and the Verb (the action taken",6,docs_monitoring-job-status.txt
lytics,Exporting Audit Logs or Alert Jobs,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/monitoring-job-status," on the subject, like created, updated, deleted, or failed).
Creating an Audit Log export (aka System Alert) Job via the UI
Creating a job to export your Audit and System Event logs is like creating any other job; for more information, see
Data Pipeline-> Jobs.
In the Filters panel, simply select Audit Logs to create an export of your Audit logs or System Events.
Depending on your Provider, you can then select to export System Events.
For example, if you selected Google Cloud and you want to export the events to BigQuery.
Then, you'd want to select the BigQuery: Export System Events Job-Type tile.
After choosing the Job-Type, it's like configuring any other export job.
In the case of BigQuery, you can do a one-time or continuous export.
Creating an Alert based on System Events
Creating a job to alert on an Audit and System Event logs is like creating any other job; for more information, see
Data Pipeline-> Jobs.
In the Filters panel, simply select Audit Logs to create an export of your",7,docs_monitoring-job-status.txt
lytics,Exporting Audit Logs or Alert Jobs,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/monitoring-job-status," Audit logs or System Events.
Depending on your Provider, you can then select to export System Events or Email Alerts.
For example, if you select to get an email when an Alert is triggered, then use Lytics as your provider and select Email Alerts.
Then configure what Subject you wanted to listen too and what Event Types (aka Verbs).
Filtering Audit logs
Audit logs can be filtered by
Subject Type: what the event is about, such as work, workflow, user, campaign. See the list of subject types below.
Subject ID: identifier of a subject, such as work ID, workflow ID, campaign ID, etc.
Verb: action described by the event performed on a subject. See the list of available verbs below.

Job Status Monitoring via Webhooks
Job-status events can be observed by creating a webhook subscription that POSTs data (or JSON) to a specific URL. These updates, like email alerting and reporting, can be consumed downstream for your monitoring use cases.
Some common examples include listening for audience exports created/updated/deleted or being notified whenever a batch import or export for a given integration fails.
Work related filters
For events related to the subject type work, the following verbs may be emitted:
synccomplete - Emitted when a sync operation is completed.
updated -",11,docs_monitoring-job-status.txt
lytics,Exporting Audit Logs or Alert Jobs,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/monitoring-job-status," Emitted when the job configuration is modified.
created - Emitted when a new job is created.
deleted - Emitted when a job is terminated.
synced - Emitted when the job sync operation completes.
completed - Emitted when a job has finished successfully.
started - Emitted when a job begins execution.
failed - Emitted when a job encounters an error.
syncing - Emitted while a job is actively syncing.
Building custom Alerts/Exports using our Webhook Integration
Overview
Lytics provides a webhook integration that allows you to monitor and react to system events in real-time. This integration enables you to build automated workflows, trigger external actions, and maintain synchronization with your other systems based on events occurring within Lytics.
Configuration Examples
Basic Webhook Setup
The following example shows how to subscribe to multiple event types and send them to a webhook endpoint:
JSON{
""config"": {
""system_event_multiple_types"": [""updated"", ""created"", ""failed""],
""webhook_url"":",12,docs_monitoring-job-status.txt
lytics,Exporting Audit Logs or Alert Jobs,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/monitoring-job-status," ""YOUR_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT"",
""headers"": {
""custom-header"": ""header-value""
}
},
""workflow"": ""webhook_system_events""
}
Slack Integration
You can integrate Lytics system events with Slack using a custom JSON template. This example shows how to send failure notifications to a Slack channel:
JSON{
""config"": {
""system_event_type"": ""failed"",
""webhook_url"": ""YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"",
""json_template"": ""local note = if std.objectHas(event.data, \""notes\"") then event.data.notes else \""A work failed\""; {\""text\"": \""Alert notification: \"" + note + \"". For more info go to: https://activate.getlytics.com/data/integrations/work/%s?aid=%s\"" % [event.data.subject_id, event.data.aid] }""
},
""workflow"": ""webhook_system_events""
}
Advanced Filtering
You can filter events by source type and ID using the system_event_sources configuration:
Filter by Specific IDs
JSON{
""config"": {
""system_event_multiple_types"": [""updated"", ""created"", ""failed""],
""system_event_sources"": {
""work"": [
""work-id-1"",
""work-id-2""
]
},
""webh",13,docs_monitoring-job-status.txt
lytics,Exporting Audit Logs or Alert Jobs,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/monitoring-job-status,"ook_url"": ""YOUR_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT"",
""headers"": {
""custom-header"": ""header-value""
}
},
""workflow"": ""webhook_system_events""
}
Monitor All Events of a specific Verb Type
To receive events for all works in your account, use an empty array.
JSON{
""config"": {
""system_event_multiple_types"": [""updated"", ""created"", ""failed""],
""system_event_sources"": {
""work"": []
},
""webhook_url"": ""YOUR_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT"",
""headers"": {
""custom-header"": ""header-value""
}
},
""workflow"": ""webhook_system_events""
}
Best Practices
Ensure your webhook endpoint can handle the expected volume of events
Implement proper error handling and retry logic in your webhook receiver
Use HTTPS endpoints for secure data transmission
Monitor webhook delivery success rates and implement appropriate alerting

Adobe Campaign
Lytics can export file based data to Adobe Campaign via hourly/daily CSV file export to an SFTP location. Adobe Campaign can import CSV files from its own secure location. This is more of a limitation on the Adobe Campaign side regarding limited API access.
Adobe Analytics
There are many ways to get data into Lytics from Adobe Analytics. One common method is to use the Lytics Javascript tag (jstag.send) function to send eVars directly from the data layer into",7,docs_adobe.txt
lytics,Adobe,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/adobe," Lytics on page load. This method will simplify the onboarding process and minimize the need to do a data transfer from Adobe Analytics on a regular basis.
As part of onboarding, we can help identify which data you would like to pull in for activation and identify the right mechanisms for ingestion. Lytics provides ways to ingest this data from scheduled SFTP pickups to Bulk API imports or transactional APIs.
Adobe Target
Our Javascript Tag will communicate user audience membership to Adobe Target, which will respond with the appropriate site personalizations.
This Lytics data will be returned from our platform on page load and the Users Profile, segmentation information and content recommendations will be placed in the web page data layer.
You can pass this information simply by leveraging the lio.data.segments object that is loaded onto every page where the Lytics JS tag is deployed.
Adobe Ad Cloud

lytics,Adobe,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/adobe,"nces via SFTP, Json file upload, API (Lytics can create a webhook to stream data - but more conversation with Adobe will be needed) as well as direct from other Adobe products like Adobe Audience Manager.
Lytics can also directly send audiences from Lytics into ad platforms (e.g. Facebook, Google, Linkedin, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, LiveRamp.

Suggest EditsThe following configuration options are available within the account settings JavaScript Tag section.
Client Side Integrations
A set of client-side integrations is facilitated by the core Lytics SDK. Each of those integrations is either deployed or disabled based on a series of checkboxes under the ""Client Side Integrations"" section. Each of those options follows the pattern outlined below.
Checking the box enables the integration and will result in either audience membership or attributes being passed to a partner if that particular integration's associated tags and configurations are also in place on the page.
Client-side integrations supported out of the box:

Yahoo Ads: Allow Lytics to pass the current visitor's _uid to Yahoo and receive a unique Yahoo ID for improved identity resolution.
In addition to those outlined above, many automatic client-side integrations are included within the Lytics core SDK. These integrations automatically sync enabled profile data with other tools if those tools have been configured on your site, too. For instance, Lytics will sync audience membership for the current visitor with Meta if the Meta pixel is also present on the page. To prevent these syncs, each integration can be blocked by adding the proper key to the ""Integrations Blocklist"" as outlined below:
In this example, we have added the ""google_analytics_dimensions"" slug to the blocklist to prevent sending profile data to custom dimensions in Google Universal Analytics.

User fields and mappings are essential for materializing user profiles in such a way that provides businesses with a comprehensive view of their customers. User fields capture specific attributes and characteristics, while mappings transform and cleanse data for consistency and accuracy. This ensures your profiles are materialized in an ideal way to support highly relevant and personalized marketing campaigns.
What are fields?
Fields can include demographic data, behavioral data, or any other data point that is relevant to understanding and engaging with customers. In addition, fields themselves are defined by one of many common data types, such as strings, integers, sets, and maps.
What are mappings?
Sometimes, you may want to transform or cleanse messy data before it hits a profile.
Other times, you may want to perform an ope",6,docs_fields-mappings.txt
lytics,Fields & Mappings,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/fields-mappings,"ration or aggregation to reflect its usefulness for business decisions or segmentation — like aggregating multiple purchases into a combined lifetime spend metric. In either case, mappings provide the necessary translation layer to ensure each data point collected is clean and consistent. Most importantly, mappings guide the relationship between disparate data points and the final materialized user profile.
Managing User Fields
Lytics' profiles are composed of a collection of user fields.
These fields have standard metadata (name, description) and typical properties you'd expect from a traditional database column (kind/type, capacity).
In addition, each field has a merge operator that describes how we want to combine data from different sources at different times into a single field.
For example, a field describing a customer's first purchase date would use a minimum operator to ensure that, regardless of the order in which Lytics sees purchase data, the first purchase date for the fie",7,docs_fields-mappings.txt
lytics,Fields & Mappings,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/fields-mappings,"ld would represent the earliest possible value.
Creating a User Field
To create a user field, visit Fields under the Schema tab in the main navigation at the left of your window. Here you will find a list of all current field definitions. Clicking on + Create New will enter the field creation wizard.
The field creation wizard has a single step where you will define a few parameters related to your new user field.
ID: An alphanumeric key that defines how this user field will be stored on the profile.
Short Description: A user-friendly description that will be used throughout the ID to provide additional context to the field.
Data Type: The type of data that will be stored in this field.
Long Description: An optional long description that provides additional context in a few areas throughout the UI.
Categories: An optional categorization for the field in question. This helps further inform the intent of the field and enhances our ability to measure the comprehensiveness of your user prof",8,docs_fields-mappings.txt
lytics,Fields & Mappings,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/fields-mappings,"ile and overall C360 readiness index (coming soon).
Identity: A field to identify a user within Lytics or in a downstream channel tool.
Governance: Any context related to consent, governance, etc.
Interests: Information supporting surfacing and understanding a consumer's interests, such as a product purchase.
Behavior: Interactions to be used in understanding behavioral patterns such as page views and non-conversion-related clicks.
First Party: Any standard first-party data.
Intelligence: ML/AI-related attributes such as LTV ingested from BigQuery or scores related to Lytics models.
Activation: Data points related to supporting or monitoring activation in downstream channels.
Merge Operator: How the merge between two different data points mapped to the same field will be handled.
Identity Key: A true or false statement identifying if the field should be used as a key to link two or more independent events together.
Keep Days: The number of days to keep values for this field.
Capacity: ",9,docs_fields-mappings.txt
lytics,Fields & Mappings,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/fields-mappings,"The number of values to store in the set.
PII (Personally Identifiable Information) Key: A true or false statement identifying if the field is to be considered PII (Personally Identifiable Information).
Data Types
Standard:
Data TypeDescriptionstringStores a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, punctuation) with no set limitation for length.integerStores positive or negative whole numbers without decimals. 64-bit.numberStores positive or negative numbers with decimals. 64 bit.booleanStores only true or false values.dateStores datetime.
Advanced:
Data TypeDescription[]stringStores an array of unique string values[]timeStores an array of unique datetime valuesdate[]stringStores a time-ordered unique array of strings (useful for keeping track of order in which they performed set of unique events)map[string]datatypeStores a set of key-value pairs. The key is a unique string and the value is a the specified data type. The value by default will be the most recent value.
map[string]strin",10,docs_fields-mappings.txt
lytics,Fields & Mappings,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/fields-mappings,"g
map[string]integer
map[string]number
map[string]boolean
map[string]datemap[string]intsumStores a set of key-value pairs. The key is a unique string and the value is an integer, but, unlike a map[string]integer, the default merge operator is sum, so the values are summed together.
Merge Operators
Supported merge operators are as follows:
Minimum: When comparing two values, take the smallest one.
Maximum: When comparing two values, take the largest one.
Oldest: When comparing two values, take the one with the oldest timestamp.
Latest: When comparing two values, take the one with the most recent timestamp.
Merge: When comparing two sets, take the union of the two.
Capacity and Keep Days
The keep_days and capacity properties specify the amount of time to keep values, and the number of values to retain in a set field, respectively. Any values in the set older than keep_days in the past will be discarded when the profile is evaluated, and no more than capacity values will be stored in the ",11,docs_fields-mappings.txt
lytics,Fields & Mappings,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/fields-mappings,"set. When values are removed from a set due to exceeding the capacity limit, they are removed in FIFO (first in, first out) order. If keep_days or capacity are set to 0 or omitted when creating a field, they are ignored.
Maintaining a User Field
As your schema grows in complexity, keeping an eye on the defined relationships is essential. The field summary provides a window into how a single user field is being populated from various channels. This view is excellent for diagnosing what may be causing a conflict or that things are operating healthily.
Deleting User Fields
Sometimes you may want to remove a user field from your schema altogether. This can be done from the field summary pictured above. Click the menu with three docs to the right of Edit Field and you will be presented with a sub-menu. This menu contains a Delete option.
🚧Deleting a field can have major implications once the change has been published. It is important to understand the implications of deleting a field and ho",12,docs_fields-mappings.txt
lytics,Fields & Mappings,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/fields-mappings,"w it will impact how data is processed and mapped to user profiles.
What happens when I delete a field?
As shown in the screenshot above, selecting and confirming deletion will not have an immediate impact. The delete will request will be referenced in the unpublished version of your schema. You must publish a new version of your schema for the changes to take effect. At that point, it is essential to understand the following:
Data previously collected and mapped to that field will no longer be accessible on the user profile.
Any existing mappings related to that field will no longer be implemented as new events occur.
Any mappings that are associated with this field will need to be independently deleted. Failing to delete associated mappings manually will result in validation errors when attempting to publish the schema version.
Managing Mappings
Mappings are expressions that provide instructions for how to perform transformations (if any) on raw data.
They can range from simple to ex",13,docs_fields-mappings.txt
lytics,Fields & Mappings,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/fields-mappings,"pressive or even include conditional logic.
Mappings occur when data is processed or observed within Lytics' real-time profile pipeline.
Multiple mappings can map data into a single field, where the field's merge operator controls updates.
Let's say we have a user currently visiting the lytics.com website, and we observe the following data sent from JSTag:
JSON{
""email_address"": ""[email protected]"",
""_uid"": ""123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"",
""utm_campaign"": ""exciting_campaign"",
""url"": ""www.lytics.com/get-started"",
""event_type"": ""page-view""
}
Based on the data from the event, we might consider some of the following mappings:
email_address: no transformation performed, and takes the value of the email as-is.
email(email_address): use the email function to validate that the email address is syntactically valid.
email(oneof(email_address, emailAddress)): coalesce either email_address or emailAddress to extract the value of the email address.
count(event_type) IF event_type == ""page-vi",14,docs_fields-mappings.txt
lytics,Fields & Mappings,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/fields-mappings,"ew"": sets up a counter to track page views, only if the event is of type ""page-view"".
Creating a Mapping
To create a mapping visit Mappings under the Schema tab in the main navigation at the left of your window. Here you will find a list of all current mapping definitions. Clicking on + Create New will enter the mapping creation wizard.
The mapping creation wizard has a single step where you will define a few parameters related to your new mapping.
Stream: The name of the stream for which to apply the mapping to.
Expression: The rules to apply to the mapping.
Condition: An optional condition statement of when to apply the mapping.
Maintaining Mappings
Since mappings depend on the data available to a stream, monitoring that things are working as desired is important. For instance, if a key changes or stops streaming entirely, it may negatively impact your profiles and, ultimately, your marketing efforts. As such, the mapping summary view is available to review the health of mappings and",15,docs_fields-mappings.txt

Consumers engage with your brand across many channels, resulting in vast amounts of rich behavioral data siloed away across various channel tools. Lytics connects to these channels via Jobs to aggregate and unify that data into a comprehensive view of the customer. This enables you to gain deeper insights, create personalized experiences, and drive revenue.
📘The landscape in which your consumers interact is broad. To ensure Lytics makes it easy to both collect and deliver essential data, insights, and audiences, we have a variety of integration options.
The Basics
Import Jobs are managed by Lytics and are responsible for automating, where applicable, the process of:
Authenticating and managing a connection to an external system.
Gathering data from an external system and ingesting it in",6,docs_data-sources.txt
lytics,Jobs (Data Sources and Exports),https://docs.lytics.com/docs/data-sources," Lytics on sensible data streams.
Handling errors and ""retry"" logic.
Determining the cadence at which the job should run again.
Similarly, Export Jobs are managed by Lytics and are responsible for automating, where applicable, the process of:
Authenticating and managing a connection to an external system.
Gathering data like user attributes, audiences or events from Lytics and exporting it to an external system.
Handling errors and ""retry"" logic.
Determining the cadence at which the job should run again.
Adding a new Job
New data import Jobs are added from the Conductor interface by first navigating to the Jobs section under the Pipeline section in the main navigation.
From there, you'll click ""+ Create New"" at the top of the list and enter the wizard to guide you through the creation process.
Configuring a Job
Select a Provider
Each Job is first categorized by the provider, making it easy to narrow down the channel you'd like to integrate with. To select a provider, click the tile rep",7,docs_data-sources.txt
lytics,Jobs (Data Sources and Exports),https://docs.lytics.com/docs/data-sources,"resenting your desired provider, such as ""Google.""
Select Job Type
With the provider selected, we'll surface the various ways you can integrate with that particular provider. This will vary significantly by the provider.
Select Authorization Method
Each provider and job type may require additional authorization to finalize the connection. On the ""select authorization"" step, you can either select an existing authorization or create a new one. When creating a new authorization, you will be asked to provide the required credentials, such as key and secret, to proceed.
Create New Authorization
You can create it during source configuration if you lack valid authorization for your desired provider/source combination. Click ""Create new Authorization"" above the list, follow the wizard in Vault, and return to where you left off.
Configure Job
The final step lets you provide the specific configuration details for your chosen provider and job type. Again, the options supported by each provider wi",8,docs_data-sources.txt
lytics,Jobs (Data Sources and Exports),https://docs.lytics.com/docs/data-sources,"ll vary greatly, and provider-specific integration details should be leveraged to determine the optimal approach.
Monitoring a Job
Once you have one or more Source jobs running, they will be accessible from the Source list view, as pictured below. This view provides quick access to essential details:
Name: Name of job, such as ""Export of High-Value Users to Facebook.""
Authorization: Name of the associated authorization.
Provider: Third-party tool that you are connecting with Lytics.
Type: Indicates whether the job is an import, export, or enrichment.
Status: Current state of a job such as running, paused, completed, etc.
Created: Date the job was initially created.
Job Status
Detailed states are provided to understand better what is happening in the background during a job's lifecycle. These states will vary by job but include:
Job StatusDescriptionRunningThe job is actively running.SleepingThe job is not actively running but is scheduled to run again after a given period. A job is sle",9,docs_data-sources.txt
lytics,Jobs (Data Sources and Exports),https://docs.lytics.com/docs/data-sources,"eping either because the job runs on a periodic cadence with scheduled sleep in between job runs or the job has encountered an error and is sleeping before retrying the request.FailedThe job has encountered consecutive errors over 10 hours and is removed from running again. Check the logs to see if there are any fixable issues. Failed works can be resumed, which will schedule it to run again. Failed jobs will be automatically purged after 90 days.PausedA user has paused the job. The work can be scheduled to run again by resuming the job. Paused works will be automatically purged after 90 days.CompletedThe job has completed all its scheduled tasks and will not be rerun. These will be purged from the job history after 90 days.
For more information on job states or troubleshooting failed jobs, see job processing.
Job Summary
Clicking on any of the items in the Source list will navigate to its dedicated summary view for greater detail. This summary provides all the relevant information abo",10,docs_data-sources.txt
lytics,Jobs (Data Sources and Exports),https://docs.lytics.com/docs/data-sources,"ut each job you've created in Lytics and an entry point to alter the configuration or status.
At the top of the Job Summary page, you’ll find the following quick-access information:
Status: Indicates the current state of a job. See the table below for descriptions of each status.
Provider: Third-party tool that you are connecting with Lytics, such as Facebook, Google, Mailchimp, etc.
Type: Indicates whether the job is an import, export, or enrichment.
Job Name: Name of the job, such as “Import Users & Activity” or “Export Audiences.”
Authorization: Name of the authorization, such as “Main Salesforce auth.”
Created By: Lytics user who created the authorization.
Last Updated: Date the job was most recently edited.
📘You can edit the name and description of an existing job from its summary page to improve the organization and clarity of your account's list of jobs.
Metrics
The activity chart will provide metrics (if available) on a job's performance to give a better understanding of how yo",11,docs_data-sources.txt
lytics,Jobs (Data Sources and Exports),https://docs.lytics.com/docs/data-sources,"ur data is flowing in and out of Lytics. You can see the number of profiles the job added, removed, or omitted during the selected time frame. Note this feature is currently in development. Once metrics are available for each job, this chart will become populated.
Configuration
The configuration section displays a JSON view of your job's current configuration. This includes details such as the authorization used, where data is coming from, which data is being pulled in, etc.
Logs
The Logs section records the history of events for this job, details about the work completed, and the time each job was run. The logs are helpful to ensure your work is running as expected and for troubleshooting if any issues arise. Below are descriptions of the job events you may see in the logs.

Backfilling Data
Some use cases involve having historical data available for segmentation.
This data might be demographic in nature, or describe how customers prefer to be contacted. This document offers guidelines for cases where large amounts of this data must be available in your Lytics account.
Best Practices
Separate Backfill from Real-time Streams
A real-time data stream contains messages sent in response to the activity they describe. This is distinguished from batched data streams, where messages are sent in groups on a given schedule or according to another trigger.
For attributes that will be kept updated by a real-time stream, there is the additional requirement to populate that attribute",13,docs_data-sources.txt
lytics,Jobs (Data Sources and Exports),https://docs.lytics.com/docs/data-sources," with a substantial amount of pre-existing information, separating that backfilling from now-forward messages.
Backfill messages can be sent using multiple means. API loads should be sent via the bulk CSV or bulk JSON endpoints. It is also possible to use integration workflows to import this data, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3.
The benefit of separating this data from real-time message streams is that the processing of backfill messages does not impact the processing time of messages received from real-time streams. The bulk imports are processed in parallel to real-time messages. This means that marketing activations reliant on real-time updates are not affected.
Utilize Timestamps
Whenever possible, all messages should have an explicit timestamp. While all messages are additionally time stamped by Lytics at the time of ingestion, specifying a message timestamp is helpful in all circumstances, particularly in cases when messages are received out of order so that Lytics knows wh",14,docs_data-sources.txt
lytics,Jobs (Data Sources and Exports),https://docs.lytics.com/docs/data-sources,"ich one is the most up-to-date.
It is essential when a backfill occurs concurrently with a real-time stream of the same attribute.
All means of loading data permit specifying timestamps. Via API, this is via a timestamp_field URL parameter. In the Admin UI, data import configuration options feature a menu to pick among the file schema for a timestamp field.
Evaluate Necessity
All messages imported into your Lytics account are stored in their raw form and represented as profile attributes in the graph. The purpose of storing all messages is to enable the reprocessing of those messages, a process called rebuilding. Rebuilding enables all received messages to be represented differently with different attributes, identity resolution rules, etc.
All data ingested into Lytics incrementally increase the overhead of rebuilding, making it a longer and more processing-intensive operation. Therefore, before importing large amounts of data, consider the value/benefit of that data. If there is no c",15,docs_data-sources.txt

Suggest EditsWhat is a Cookie
An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.
Cookie Flavors
First-party
First-party cookies are created by the host domain – the domain the user is visiting. These cookies are generally considered good; they help provide a better user experience and keep the session open. This means the browser can remember key information, such as items you add to shopping carts, username,",6,docs_client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive.txt
lytics,Client & Server Side Cookies,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive," and language preferences.
Third-party
Third-party cookies are those created by domains other than the one the user is visiting at the time and are mainly used for tracking and online-advertising purposes. They also allow website owners to provide certain services, such as live chats.
Common Cookie Use Cases
Session management
Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember.
Personalization
User preferences, themes, and other settings.
Tracking
Recording and analyzing user behavior.
How does Lytics use cookies?
Cookies are one of the preferred methods for maintaining a user identifier in the browser, both known and anonymous. This gets associated with all inbound events captured by our Javascript tag as they interact with customer websites. Specifically, our Javascript tag stores a string of digits and characters that are used as a unique ID commonly referred to as our _uid or, in some cases seerid as a first-party cookie.
Creating & Managing Cookies
Wh",7,docs_client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive.txt
lytics,Client & Server Side Cookies,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive,"ere do cookies come from?
Client-Side
In web development, the client-side refers to everything in a web application displayed on the client (end-user device). This includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any actions an application performs within the user's browser.
When someone refers to a “client-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and/or managed via a common client-side programming language such as Javascript.
Server Side
Like with client-side, server-side means everything that happens on the server instead of on the client. In the past, nearly all business logic ran on the server-side, including rendering dynamic webpages, interacting with databases, identity authentication, and push notifications.
When someone refers to a “server-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and managed using one of the many common server-side programming languages such as NodeJS, PHP, Python,",8,docs_client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive.txt
lytics,Client & Server Side Cookies,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive," etc.
Cookie Ingredients
Name
Defines the cookie name. Generally, the cookie name is the primary way of retrieving a cookie and its associated value and attributes.
Value
The stored value for the cookie. This can include any US-ASCII character excluding a control character, whitespace, double quotes, comma, semicolon, and backslash.
Expires
Indicates the maximum lifetime of the cookie as an HTTP-date timestamp. See Date for the required formatting.
Max-Age
Indicates the number of seconds until the cookie expires. A zero or negative number will expire the cookie immediately.
Domain
Defines the host to which the cookie will be sent.
Path
Indicates the path that must exist in the requested URL for the browser to send the Cookie header.
Secure
This indicates that the cookie is sent to the server only when a request is made with the HTTPS: scheme (except on localhost) and, therefore, is more resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks.
HttpOnly
Forbids JavaScript from accessing the cookie, for e",9,docs_client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive.txt
lytics,Client & Server Side Cookies,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive,"xample, through the Document.cookie property. Note that a cookie created with HttpOnly will still be sent with JavaScript-initiated requests, for example, when calling XMLHttpRequest.send() or fetch(). This mitigates attacks against cross-site scripting (XSS).
SameSite
Controls whether or not a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF).
Who’s taking away my cookies?!?
In June 2017, Apple introduced a new privacy feature called Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP). This same feature was officially released in September 2017 with Safari 12 and iOS 11. Since then, the ITP has evolved and introduced several subsequent versions leading us to the current state (as of July 2022), which has many impacts on marketing but most notably:
ITP blocks all third-party cookies by default. (ITP 1.0/1.1)
ITP can grant exceptions to third-party cookies with Storage API. (ITP 2.0)

As a result of the privacy and security efforts in general other browsers such as Mozilla’s Firefox(ETP) and Google Chrome have followed suit in announcing and/or implementing their security and tracking protocols, which continue to impact tools such as third and first-party cookies that have long been a staple in providing the data necessary for marketers to personalize their communications effectively.
What can I do to replace my cookies?
With each iteration on more stringent privacy-related changes comes a wave of workarounds or alternate approaches to maintaining access to behavioral data essential to marketing:
1. Deploy a strong first-party identification strategy.
There is no replacement then a strong identification strategy. Creating a relationship in which a user will openly share their identity through a login or some other authenticated means will",11,docs_client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive.txt
lytics,Client & Server Side Cookies,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive," always result in the highest level of certainty on identity, which leads to the best level of personalization. However, many use cases focus on anonymous users or users who have not built up the relationship necessary to unlock this level of authentication.
2. First-party client-side cookies have changed but are still a viable solution.
Though third-party cookies are effectively dead, first-party cookies are still viable for many use cases. Not only do they offer a very simple off-the-shelf type of implementation for leveraging, they also have a long shelf life, assuming that an anonymous user interacts frequently enough to overcome the 7-day expiration window.
3. First-party server-side cookies offer an extended expiration window.
Over the past 12 months, there has been a surge of interest in server-side cookies. This method for setting cookies currently is not affected by the ITP changes that impact client-side cookies, most notably the automatic expiration at seven days. Rather, se",12,docs_client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive.txt
lytics,Client & Server Side Cookies,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive,"rver-side cookies can live for long periods, leading to a higher quality identification for anonymous users. The downside, however, is they are far more difficult to leverage than the client-side. They require a much more technical integration with whatever server-side technology is used to power the web asset and may not be accessible in the same manner as client-side cookies.
Getting Technical with Server Side Cookies
In general, regardless of the specific attribute settings used when leveraging server-side cookies, they currently are not impacted by the 7-day expiration window that client-side cookies fall victim to. However, Apple has made it clear that they have additional plans to extend some of the client-side cookie limitations to the server-side, and the most important attribute in that discussion is the HttpOnly attribute.

lytics,Client & Server Side Cookies,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive,"plementations. As such, even though a non-HttpOnly server-side cookie offers an easier means to bypass current client-side restrictions, it is our recommendation to consider investing to leverage HttpOnly cookies set by the server-side to prevent any potential impacts of the next few iterations of ITP. Below we’ll explore the two options and demonstrate the key differences.
Server Side Cookie without HttpOnly
The following example in Node.js demonstrates a sample snippet for setting the cookie server side. Most server-side languages have existing methods to make this very easy. In the case of creating a cookie for Lytics to leverage, you will also need to generate a unique ID which can be done in a variety of ways. In the case of Node, you may consider using the randomUUID() method of the Crypto interface. A simple Google search can lead you or your developer down the road of generating a unique ID that best fits your use case.
Once you have that unique ID, you simply set the cookie us",14,docs_client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive.txt
lytics,Client & Server Side Cookies,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive,"ing the pre-defined Lytics name our Javascript tag is looking for. Alternatively, the tag can be configured to use any custom name.
// THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS A UNTESTED AND NON-PRODUCTION LEVEL
// EXAMPLE OF HOW TO SET A COOKIE SERVER SIDE WITH NODE.JS AND
// ACCESS THE DOCUMENT.COOKIES FROM THE CLIENT SIDE
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
var crypto = require('crypto');
var dayjs = require('dayjs');
// cookieParser middleware
app.use(cookieParser());
// route for setting the cookies
app.get('/setcookie', function (req, res) {
// setting a server side cookie without httponly
res.cookie(""seerid"", crypto.randomUUID(), {
httpOnly: false,
expires: dayjs().add(30, ""days"").toDate(),
});
res.send(`<html><body><p>A server side cookie has been set.</p></body></html>`);
})
// Route for getting all the cookies
app.get('/getcookie', function (req, res) {
res.send(`

);
})
app.listen(3000, (err) => {
if (err) throw err;
console.log('server running on port 3000');
});
Since non-HttpOnly cookies are accessible out of the box client-side there is no additional lift necessary. Our tag will pick up the cookie and use that ID as the identifier. It is important to note that any UID changes must also be managed server-side as setting the cookie client-side will engage the 7-day expiration max. In this example, we simply raise an alert with the cookie string and do not show the actual implementation of the Lytics tag.
Server Side Cookie with HttpOnly
Setting HttpOnly to true comes with an additional level of complexity but benefits from following the stringent and recommended guidelines of Apple ITP, which in theory will go farther in the way of future-proofing.
Much like the above example, we’ll set a cookie, in this case using Node, in the same way. The only differenc",16,docs_client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive.txt
lytics,Client & Server Side Cookies,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive,"e here is setting httpOnly to true. This means that the cookie is secure but will no longer be accessible out of the box by Javascript. Rather, you’ll have to implement an alternative method for surfacing that ID to Javascript so that it can be passed to the Lytics Javascript tag and used during collection/resolution.

Universal Schema
Lytics' universal schema delivers a set of intelligent attributes that are universal to every profile that gets created, regardless of data source, age, or their anonymous or known status.
These attributes include rich behavioral models, AI-derived interests, and identity resolution metadata, leading to more comprehensive insights on all of your profiles.

There are 100 possible splits (0-99), so creating an audience where _split = 44 would result in a random subset of 1% of profiles.
A random split where _split < 50 would result in a subset of 50% of profiles.

Having access to two random split assignments allows you to target 100*100, or 10k different subsets of your audiences.
This means you can create splits that are capable of targeting down to 0.01% of profiles.

Lytics' SegmentML models provide scores for modeling custom outcomes in Lookalike models.
Each active model attaches a score (between 0 and 1) to a profile with its name.
segment_prediction_percentile
Similar to segment_prediction values, the percentiles provide the ability to create audiences and target users based on their percentile instead of their raw score.
This enables you, for example, to create audiences of users with the top 10% of scores (by using segment_prediction_percentile > 90).

lytics,Lytics Profile Schema,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/navigation-management-1," Schema
Common fields help to structure your profiles in a way for developers to easily plug into them, and for marketers to easily use them in personalization.
Common mappings help to translate your source data into a format that can be used by common fields.
These fields and mappings help to provide consistency in your profiles, regardless of the source from which the data came.
For example, your CRM might have ""tax_exempt"": ""true"", while your data warehouse might has ""tax_status"": ""exempt"", and your ESP might have ""is_tax_exempt"": 1.
In Lytics' Common Schema, this would simply be represented as ""tax_exempt"": true.
Pre-defined Mappings
For your convenience, Jobs managed in your Data Pipeline will automatically create schema fields and mappings to implement Lytics Common Schema in your data so that you can get to more use cases more quickly with our Inspiration Library.

Data Model Field Creation
Upon activation of a Data Model, Lytics will automatically create one customer profile field which represents the membership of a user for the Data Model. Additional fields will be created if the Data Model was configured to include Activated Fields. Below is a guide for how to locate these generated fields within a customer profile or within the Audience Builder (on the Custom Fields tab)

If you need to disable a Cloud Connect Data Model from syncing at any point, you can do so by navigating to the Data Model and clicking the Deactivate button.

lytics,Activating Data Models,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/leveraging-cloud-connect-audiences,"es; however, it will cause the values for these fields to become out of date. In order to completely remove the fields from schema/profiles, the Data Model must be deleted.
Total Records vs. Count of Users
Throughout the app, you may see different metrics for Cloud Connect Data Models.
Total Records within the Data Model Summary
On the summary page for your Cloud Connect Data Model, under the Total Records statistic (shown in the graph below), you will see the number of records that are selected by the query based on the unique number of primary keys in the origin database. This may be equal to or less than the number of total rows imported and may be significantly higher than the number you see in the audience builder when utilizing this Data Model.
Count of Users within the Audience Builder
When adding Cloud Connect Data Model membership or activated fields to audience logic in the Audience Builder, you may see a smaller size than the Total Records on the summary. The count of users ",8,docs_leveraging-cloud-connect-audiences.txt
lytics,Activating Data Models,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/leveraging-cloud-connect-audiences,"within the Audience Builder is the number of users in your Lytics account who met the qualifications for the query based on the matching Lytics user field configured on the Data Model. This number reflects the number of records that would be included if you were to run an export of the audience.
Most common reasons for why this number may be smaller than the Total Records metric are the following:
If the ""Create New Profiles"" option isn't selected on the Data Model, the count of users in the Audience Builder will only include profiles that already existed in your Lytics accounts
Audience Builder will exclude any profiles which are marked as being Unhealthy. Learn more about unhealthy profiles here - https://docs.lytics.com/docs/user-profile-health#unhealthy-profiles
Exporting Data Models
Once activating a Data Model, its associated fields will be stored as user fields on the customer profile (to see the naming convention here) . Therefore, in order to export the members of the Data Mod",9,docs_leveraging-cloud-connect-audiences.txt
lytics,Activating Data Models,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/leveraging-cloud-connect-audiences,"el, you will first need to create an audience in the Audience Builder. You can create an audience of only members or layer in additional audience rules to get the most out of your customer data.
For example, you could build a Cloud Connect audience using account-level data for a B2B use case and add one of Lytics behavioral scores to refine your targeting based on your desired user engagement level.

Lytics Job runtime and APIs control the mechanics of how data flows in and out of Lytics.
Lytics jobs can be generally broken down into a few important categories:
Direction: Does this job route data to Lytics, or from Lytics?
Subject: Does this job target entities (commonly known as profiles)? Or does it target raw events?
Schedule: What starts this workflow?
Is it based on real-time triggers?
Or does it run on a batching schedule?
Termination: Is this a one-time job, or is it expected to run again?
If so, on what frequency?
Knowing which type of job you're dealing with can help guide expectations for behavior and troubleshooting.
Auths
Some jobs, like specific Webhook flows, don't require explicit credentials to access external systems.
However, most jobs require some form of authorization to retrieve data from or send data to external sy",6,docs_background-processing.txt
lytics,Job Processing,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/background-processing,"stems.
In Lytics, these credentials are generically referred to as Authorizations.
Authorizations can be managed from the Auth API, or directly from the Lytics interface.
All authorizations are either configuration-based or OAuth-based.
Configuration: The authorization is based on credentials provided to Lytics.
These usually take the form of API keys/secrets and usernames/passwords.
OAuth: The authorization is given access delegation from an OAuth flow..
Commonly, authorizations will change – some systems require periodic password changes, tokens get revoked, users who complete OAuth flows leave an organization, etc.
Consequently, a job that is running successfully with authorization today may fail tomorrow if the authorization is no longer valid.
If you know in advance that credentials will update or change, it is recommended that you create a new authorization and update the job to use the new one.
To stay alerted on the health status of a job, you can set up alerts as described in ",7,docs_background-processing.txt
lytics,Job Processing,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/background-processing,"the Monitoring section below.
Configuring and Submitting Jobs
Jobs can be managed from the Jobs API, or directly from the Lytics interface.
Each job has custom configuration options that tell the job when to run, what type of data to pull, which lists to pull data from in external systems, how to send the data to downstream sources, etc.
Each job's API endpoint will validate the presence of any required parameters, or other conditions that must be satisfied for the job to run correctly.
In the event of a validation error in the job configuration, the API will return a 400 error with a message indicating what is misconfigured.
If the configuration for the job request is valid, the job will be immediately submitted to Lytics internal job running system.
Job State Machine
Jobs running on Lytics' internal job running system may be in any of the following states:
Runnable: The job is currently running.
Completed: The job has run successfully and is not scheduled to re-run.
Paused: The job h",8,docs_background-processing.txt
lytics,Job Processing,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/background-processing,"as been manually paused, and will remain so until it is unpaused or terminated.
Sleeping: The job is in between runs and is scheduled to run again at a later point in time.
Failed: The job has exceeded its retry limit and will not attempt to run again.
Terminated: The job has been manually terminated and will not attempt to run again.
Jobs will usually first enter into a Runnable state.
If the job is fed input from real-time triggers, it will stay running unless it encounters any errors.
If the job runs on a batched interval, it will usually switch between Runnable and Sleeping.
While most transitions happen automatically in the system (Runnable → Completed, for example), some are triggered manually, namely:
From

Errors
There are a variety of reasons a job will enter a Failed state, including:
Authoriz",9,docs_background-processing.txt
lytics,Job Processing,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/background-processing,"ation issues: This is the most common reason for job failures.
Some authorizations can become invalid if the external system requires periodic password changes and the authorization isn't updated, if tokens get revoked, or if users who complete OAuth flows leave an organization and the token no longer has access to the resources it is requesting.
External failures: Sometimes external systems can produce intermittent failures, like HTTP 503 errors if the system is temporarily unavailable.
Because of their intermittency, it's less likely that one of these errors will result in a job ending in a Failed state.
Internal Lytics failures: While rare, sometimes the availability of internal Lytics resources can cause a job to fail.
Because of the high availability of Lytics systems (>99.9%), it's unlikely that a job will be in a Failed state from Lytics internals.
When an error occurs, the job will enter a Sleeping state, and retry a minute later.
If an error occurs on the second attempted run,",10,docs_background-processing.txt
lytics,Job Processing,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/background-processing," the job will sleep double the amount of time as the previous run.
If errors still occur after two hours, the job will enter a Failed state.
Any failed work can be manually restarted, through the Job API or through the Lytics interface.
If, for example, a job is in a failed state because of an authorization issue, you can create a new authorization for the job and restart it.
Contributing
Many jobs are maintained by Lytics, and even more workflows can be enabled by using our generic tooling for Webhook and SFTP-based integration flows.
Some jobs are open-sourced and run on Conductor's Opus framework for running jobs. Check out our Conductor Opus Template on GiHub to get started creating your own jobs.Updated 11 months ago Table of Contents

lytics,Topic Taxonomy,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/topic-taxonomy,"ge CampaignRecommend Content CampaignCampaign ReportingCampaign ManagementBuilding Audiences with Campaign DataTopic Taxonomy Suggest EditsTopic Taxonomy
Using data science techniques to look at the topic overlap between classified content, Lytics will programmatically build a topic taxonomy. In addition to programmatically building this taxonomy, Lytics dynamically adjusts the taxonomy as new content gets published.
The topic taxonomy is stored as a weighted and directional graph. Although this structure may be daunting to look at—and even more daunting to try and utilize by hand—Lytics uses it when determining content recommendations.
Topic Relationships
Topics are determined to be related by evaluating how they occur together and how they occur independently. When two topics occur together frequently (meaning in multiple documents), it is safe to assume they are related. In addition to the relationship existing, Lytics will determine the direction of the relationship. Is ""Cookies"" a",6,docs_topic-taxonomy.txt
lytics,Topic Taxonomy,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/topic-taxonomy," subtopic of ""Baking"" or is ""Baking"" a subtopic of ""Cookies""?
The co-occurrence of topics determines the relationship. The independent occurrence of a topic determines the direction. Since the topic ""Cookies"" frequently occurs with ""Baking,"" but ""Baking"" frequently occurs without ""Cookies,"" ""Cookies"" must be a subtopic of ""Cookies."" To draw this example further, ""Baking"" may be a subtopic of ""Recipes,"" ""Recipes"" may be a subtopic of ""Cooking,"" and ""Cooking"" may be a subtopic of ""Hobbies.""
This is important because it allows Lytics to make affinity inferences. A user with a high affinity for ""Cookies"" may be interested in general ""Baking"" content.
Weighting Relationships
The weight between relationships is incredibly important to consider when making affinity inferences. For instance, Michael Jordan played baseball professionally for one dark year in the 90s. This means there are valid relationships between Michael Jordan and Baseball and Michael Jordan and Basketball. Most people who k",7,docs_topic-taxonomy.txt
lytics,Topic Taxonomy,https://docs.lytics.com/docs/topic-taxonomy,"now anything about sports or pop culture know Michael Jordan as a basketball icon. The way this gets reflected in taxonomy is through relationship weights. The weight between Michael Jordan and Basketball is strong, while the weight between Michael Jordan and Baseball is weak.
By having weights, affinity inferences can use those weights as thresholds for building further relationships or recommending content. A user who has shown interest in Michael Jordan is more likely to be interested in Basketball than they are to be interested in Baseball. Unless they are interested in Sports Icons From The 90s, they might be more interested in Ken Griffey Jr. A rich topic taxonomy will surface this nuanced information.
The Graph Representation of the Taxonomy
A graph is the ideal data structure for topic taxonomies and taxonomies in general. Since each topic can have many subtopics and be the subtopic of many things, the correct way to structure this data is with a graph.
Leaders in data modeling",8,docs_topic-taxonomy.txt

Die zeotap GmbH („Zeotap“, „uns“, „wir“ oder „unser“) bietet mit ihrer Customer Data Platform die Kundendatenplattform der nächsten Generation an. Marken können damit Endkundendaten künftig ohne Cookies zusammenführen, optimieren und aktivieren und zugleich Endkundendaten umfassend schützen und die maßgeblichen Vorschriften einhalten. Unsere Services nutzen entweder ausschließlich geschützte Technologien von Zeotap oder kombinieren sie mit Endkundendaten („Nutzerdaten“) Dritter („Datenpartner“) und umfassen unter anderem Zusammenführung von Endkundendaten, Identitätsbestimmung, Dateneinbindung, Datenabgleich, Datenerkenntnisse, angepasste Zielgruppenentwicklung, Analyse/Modellierung, Zielgruppenadressierung für Web- und Mobilwerbung und Datenübermittlung an Aktivierungssysteme (einschließlich Marketing-Ökosystem-Partnern) („Services“). Wie oben erwähnt fallen unsere Services in zwei Kategorien: (i) Softwareproduk",1,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy-de_.txt

Auf unserer Website erfahren Sie mehr zu unseren Services.Zeotap nimmt am IAB Europe Transparency &amp; Consent Framework teil und hält sich an dessen Spezifikationen und Richtlinien. Die Identifikationsnummer von Zeotap innerhalb des Frameworks lautet 301. Unsere Datenpartner sind Betreiber von Mobilfunknetzen, Anbieter von Mobilanwendungen, Medien, Anbieter von Technologieplattformen, Inhaber von Medienunternehmen („Publisher“), Marken, Agenturen und sonstige Partner mit Zugang zu bestimmten Nutzerdaten, die sie mithilfe unserer Services monetarisieren möchten. Unsere Kunden („Kunden“) sind Unternehme",2,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy-de_.txt

Dazu richten wir uns über den gesamten Prozess der Konzipierung, Entwicklung und Bereitstellung unserer Services nach den Grundsätzen des eingebauten Datenschutzes oder Datenschutzes durch Technik („Privacy by Design“) und datenschutzfreundlicher Voreinstellungen („Privacy by Default“). Wir sind gesetzlich verpflichtet, Ihnen folgende Informationen bereitzustellen: Art und Rechtsgrundlage der Verwendung und Weitergabe Ihrer personenbezogenen DatenMaßnahmen zur Wahrung Ihrer Datenschutzrechte im Zusammenhang mit Ihren personenbezogenen DatenMöglichkeiten der Kontaktaufnahme mit uns bei Anliegen im Zusa",3,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy-de_.txt

Für den Umgang dieser Datenpartner, Kunden und sonstigen Dritten mit personenbezogenen Daten gelten deren jeweilige Datenschutzerklärungen. Änderungen dieser Datenschutzerklärung bleiben vorbehalten.

zeotap,Datenschutzerklärung für Produkte und Services | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy-de/,"uns Erhaltene und Verwendete Datenkategorien Im Zusammenhang mit Datenprodukten erhalten wir von unseren Datenpartnern folgende Kategorien von Nutzerdaten: Geräte-IDs für Mobilwerbung, z. B. Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) von Apple oder Google Android Advertising ID („Werbe-IDs“)Cookie-IDsE-Mail-Adressen mit Hash und Telefonnummern mit HashDemografische Informationen wie Alter, Geschlecht, Ort/Region, Einkommen, Sprache und Mobilvertragsdaten wie Prepaid/Postpaid („demografische Daten“)Mobil-App-Nutzungsdaten zu Apps, die auf einem Nutzergerät installiert/geöffnet sind, und App-Ereignisse und Browser-Daten wie Browser-URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) („App-Nutzungs- und Browser-Daten“)Kaufdaten wie Interesse oder Absicht, bestimmte Produkte oder Services zu erwerbenStandortdatenWir erhalten keinerlei „besondere Kategorien personenbezogener Daten“ (d. h. Informationen zu Hautfarbe, Ethnie, religiösen oder weltanschaulichen Überzeugungen, sexueller Orientierung, Sexualleben, politisch",5,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy-de_.txt
zeotap,Datenschutzerklärung für Produkte und Services | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy-de/,"en Meinungen, Gesundheit oder Gewerkschaftsmitgliedschaft oder genetische/biometrische Daten). Wir erhalten außerdem wissentlich keine personenbezogenen Daten zu Kindern unter 16 Jahren. Unsere Datenpartner können Daten (online und offline) direkt von Nutzern erfassen oder von Dritten erhalten. Wir verlangen von unseren Datenpartnern, dass sie Nutzern alle nötigen Informationen zur Verwendung ihrer personenbezogenen Daten bereitstellen und ihnen die Ausübung ihrer Rechte nach den geltenden Gesetzen und Vorschriften ermöglichen. Darüber hinaus verwenden wir zur Erfassung der Werbe-IDs und Cookie-IDs von Nutzern möglicherweise selbst Cookies, Pixel und ähnliche Tools. Diese Tools erfassen und senden außerdem automatisch Informationen wie Verweis-URLs, Nutzer-Agent-Zeichenfolgen und IP-Adressen. Diese Informationen sind üblicherweise in Protokolldateien enthalten, die bei der Kommunikation zwischen Betriebssystemen routinemäßig ausgetauscht werden. Wenn wir von verschiedenen Datenpartnern",6,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy-de_.txt
zeotap,Datenschutzerklärung für Produkte und Services | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy-de/," mehrere Nutzerdaten zu demselben Gerät erhalten, aggregieren wir diese Nutzerdaten und speichern sie unter derselben Werbe-ID (das ist die einem Gerät zugeordnete Werbe-ID) oder Cookie-ID (das ist eine Zeichenfolge, die Websites und Server dem Browser zuordnen, auf dem das Cookie abgelegt ist). Zeotap führt außerdem ein gesondertes ID-Verzeichnis, das die Nutzerdaten unter einer gemeinsamen ID („zeoID“) zusammenführt. Es handelt sich dabei um eine Pseudonym-ID. Wir optimieren Nutzerdaten, um anonymisierte Datensegmente zu erstellen und diese ausgehend von den Präferenzen unserer Kunden zu Segmentlisten oder Werbe-/Cookie-ID-Listen zu aggregieren. Diese Listen geben wir an unsere Kunden weiter, die passende Nutzer damit erfolgreich zielgruppenspezifisch adressieren können. Wir verarbeiten keine Daten wie unverschlüsselte Namen, Adressen oder behördliche ID-Nummern, mit denen sich konkrete Personen direkt identifizieren lassen. Ob Nutzerdaten, die wir erhalten, als personenbezogene Date",7,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy-de_.txt
zeotap,Datenschutzerklärung für Produkte und Services | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy-de/,"n oder Daten gelten, die die direkte Identifizierung einer Person erlauben, hängt jedoch neben anderen Faktoren von der Definition ab, die am physischen Standort der betreffenden Nutzer gilt. In manchen Ländern kann beispielsweise die nutzerspezifische IP-Adresse zu den personenbezogenen Daten zählen, während dies in anderen Ländern nicht der Fall ist. Wir interagieren nicht direkt mit Nutzern oder ihren Geräten, sofern Nutzer uns keine wie unten aufgeführte unter „Ihre Rechte im Zusammenhang mit Ihren Personenbezogenen Daten (Einschliesslich Wiederrufsoptionen)“ beschriebene Anfrage auf Löschung senden. Beachten Sie, dass wir im Zusammenhang mit unseren Softwareprodukten von unseren Kunden möglicherweise eine Reihe zusätzlicher Kategorien an Nutzerdaten erhalten (einschließlich Daten, die die direkte Identifizierung erlauben). Die Kategorien der Nutzerdaten werden im Folgenden ausführlicher beschrieben. A. ONLINE-IDs WERBE-IDs Werbe-IDs sind eindeutige anonymisierte Kennungen für Anze",8,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy-de_.txt
zeotap,Datenschutzerklärung für Produkte und Services | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy-de/,"igen, die sich nutzerseitig zurücksetzen lassen. Werbe-IDs identifizieren ein konkretes Gerät und werden sowohl für IDFA als auch für Google Android Advertising ID implementiert. Wir erhalten von unseren Datenpartnern Werbe-IDs und damit verknüpfte anonymisierte Nutzerdaten. Unsere Kunden nutzen Werbe-IDs im Anschluss, um Anzeigenanfragen zu identifizieren und passende Werbung zu schalten. Darüber hinaus verwenden wir Werbe-IDs möglicherweise, um Beziehungen zwischen verschiedenen Nutzerdatenattributen zu einem bestimmten Nutzer herzustellen. Wenn wir beispielsweise Nutzerdaten erhalten, nach denen ein bestimmter Nutzer 25 bis 30 Jahre alt ist, und später von einem anderen Datenpartner erfahren, dass der Nutzer desselben Geräts sich für einen gesunden Lebensstil interessiert, führen wir diese Informationen unter nur einer Werbe-ID oder Cookie-ID zusammen. COOKIE-IDs HTTP-Cookies (auch als Webcookies, Internetcookies, Browsercookies oder einfach Cookies bezeichnet) sind kleine Datensätz",9,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy-de_.txt
zeotap,Datenschutzerklärung für Produkte und Services | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy-de/,"e, die von einer Website gesendet und im Webbrowser von Nutzern abgelegt werden, wenn sie im Internet surfen. Wir legen Drittanbieter-Cookies im Auftrag von Publishern ab, die Flächen für die Einblendung von Anzeigen auf Websites bereitstellen. Wir verwenden Cookies möglicherweise, um Beziehungen zwischen Geräten oder Daten zu einem bestimmten Nutzer herzustellen. Wenn wir bereits über Informationen zu dem Nutzer eines Geräts verfügen, verknüpfen wir die in Cookies gespeicherten Informationen mit der Werbe-ID des Geräts. Diese Informationsverknüpfung bezeichnen wir als „Zuordnung“. Wir nutzen diese Informationen, um die Bereitstellung zielgruppenspezifischer Anzeigen unserer Kunden zu ermöglichen. B. BROWSER-DATEN PROTOKOLLDATEIINFORMATIONEN Im Zusammenhang mit der im vorstehenden Absatz genannten Zuordnungsaktivität erhalten wir Informationen wie Verweis-URLs, Nutzer-Agent-Zeichenfolgen und IP-Adressen. Wenn Sie eine Website aufrufen, auf der Zeotap-Cookies abgelegt sind, enthält die ",10,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy-de_.txt
zeotap,Datenschutzerklärung für Produkte und Services | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy-de/,"automatisch an uns übermittelte Protokolldatei die Verweis-URL, d. h. die Adresse der Website, über die Sie die Website aufgerufen haben. Wir nutzen keine Verweis-URLs und löschen sie nach einer bestimmten Zeit entsprechend der Dauer, für die wir Daten aufbewahren. Wir verwenden IP-Adressen, um Informationen wie Land und Betreiber abzuleiten. Im Anschluss löschen wir IP-Adressen nach einer bestimmten Zeit entsprechend der Dauer, über die wir Daten aufbewahren. Wir verwenden in der Protokolldatei enthaltene Informationen in Nutzer-Agent-Zeichenfolgen, um das Betriebssystem und das Modell Ihres Geräts zu bestimmen. Im Anschluss löschen wir Nutzer-Agent-Zeichenfolgen nach einer bestimmten Zeit entsprechend der Dauer, über die wir Daten aufbewahren. C. OFFLINE-IDs E-MAIL-ADRESSEN MIT HASH UND TELEFONNUMMERN MIT HASH Manche Datenpartner oder Kunden stellen ggf. Offlinedaten wie E-Mail-Adressen mit Hash und Telefonnummern mit Hash bereit. Wir verlangen, dass der Hash-Vorgang für diese Daten ",11,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy-de_.txt
zeotap,Datenschutzerklärung für Produkte und Services | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy-de/,"vor der Weitergabe an Zeotap mit sicheren Hash-Algorithmen ausgeführt wird. Wir nutzen E-Mail-Adressen mit Hash oder Telefonnummern mit Hash, um Beziehungen zwischen Offline- und Onlinenutzerprofilen individueller Nutzer herzustellen und die Profile der entsprechenden Onlinenutzer zu erweitern. Ein Beispiel wäre ein Kunde, der eine Werbekampagne für Mobilgeräte zu einer Nutzerzielgruppe durchführen möchte, deren E-Mail-Adressen mit Hash und/oder Telefonnummern mit Hash dem Kunden bereits bekannt sind. Ohne die entsprechenden Werbe-IDs kann der Kunde die gewünschte Zielgruppe jedoch nicht adressieren. Durch den Abgleich der vom Kunden bereitgestellten E-Mail-Adressen mit Hash und Telefonnummern mit Hash mit den Nutzerdaten, die wir von unseren Datenpartnern erhalten haben, können wir E-Mail-Adressen mit Hash und Telefonnummern mit Hash den Werbe-IDs der jeweiligen Nutzer zuordnen. Das ergibt eine Liste mit Werbe-IDs, die der Liste der Nutzer entspricht, die der Kunde adressieren möchte.",12,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy-de_.txt
zeotap,Datenschutzerklärung für Produkte und Services | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy-de/," Darüber hinaus können wir diese Listen mit zusätzlichen Profildaten wie den im Folgenden beschriebenen erweitern. Anhand einer E-Mail-Adresse mit Hash lässt sich auch eine ID+ erstellen, unsere Token-Pseudonym-ID zu einem bestimmten Nutzer. Mehr zu ID+ erfahren Sie hier. D. PROFILDATEN DEMOGRAFISCHE DATEN Wir erhalten von unseren Datenpartnern möglicherweise demografische Nutzerdaten wie: Demografische Daten zu Nutzern (z. B. Alter oder Altersgruppe und Geschlecht)Allgemeine geografische Daten oder Nutzeradressen und PostleitzahlenVoraussichtliche oder tatsächliche EinkommensgruppeSonstige demografische Informationen, die unsere Datenpartner erhalten oder erfasst habenZeotap erstellt anhand dieser Informationen demografische Nutzersegmente, z. B. „männlich, 30 bis 34, in Brooklyn lebend“. Wir verknüpfen Segmente mit Werbe-IDs, damit unsere Kunden ihre Zielgruppen auf Mobilgeräten adressieren können. APP-NUTZUNGS- UND BROWSER-DATEN Wir erhalten von unseren Datenpartnern möglicherweise ",13,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy-de_.txt
zeotap,Datenschutzerklärung für Produkte und Services | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy-de/,"Daten zu App- und Browser-Nutzung wie: Auf Nutzergeräten installierte/aufgerufene AppsApp-Ereignisse wie Käufe oder AnmeldevorgängeBrowser-Daten wie URLsURLs sind Webadressen und bestehen aus einer spezifischen Zeichenfolge, die auf eine Ressource verweist. Die meisten Webbrowser zeigen die URL einer Webseite in einer Adresszeile über der Seite an. Wir wandeln App-Nutzungs- und Browser-Daten anhand von Interessen oder Kaufabsichten in aggregierte Segmente um (z. B. Sportbegeisterte, Gesundheits- und Fitnessfans), die für unsere Kunden von Interesse sind. KAUFDATEN Wir erhalten von unseren Datenpartnern möglicherweise Kaufdaten wie: Artikel, die Sie in Geschäften gekauft habenArtikel, die Sie online gekauft habenArtikel, die Sie online in einen Warenkorb gelegt haben  E. STANDORTDATEN Wir erhalten von unseren Datenpartnern möglicherweise Daten zu den physischen Standorten spezifischer Geräte, unter anderem über GPS-Tools, WLAN oder Funkmast-Triangulationsverfahren erfasste geografische ",14,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy-de_.txt
zeotap,Datenschutzerklärung für Produkte und Services | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy-de/,"Koordinaten. Bei den Standortdaten, die wir von Datenpartnern erhalten, handelt es sich möglicherweise um generalisierte, ungenaue Standortdaten. Möglicherweise wandeln wir Standortdaten in ungenaue Daten um, um unseren Kunden generalisierte Standortdaten bereitzustellen. Unsere Kunden können aus diesen Informationen Rückschlüsse ziehen, um lokalisierte Anzeigen oder zielgruppenspezifische Anzeigen zu senden. Wir verarbeiten keine genauen EU- und UK-Standortdaten. Rechtsgrundlage für die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten Mithilfe unserer Services können Kunden unter anderem Anzeigen, die Ihnen über Ihren Webbrowser oder Ihr Mobilgerät angezeigt werden, auf Ihre Interessen und Vorlieben zuschneiden. Das verringert die Zahl der Anzeigen, die für Sie nicht passend oder von Interesse sind. Dazu müssen wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten verarbeiten. Diese Verarbeitung, einschließlich der Verwendung von Cookies und anderen Tracking Technologien erfolgt im Rahmen Ihrer Einwilligung, die es u",15,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy-de_.txt
zeotap,Datenschutzerklärung für Produkte und Services | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy-de/,"nseren Kunden insbesondere ermöglicht, ihre Marketingaktivitäten und Marketingreichweite anhand angepasster Zielgruppensegmente zu verbessern und weiterzuentwickeln. Bei Datenprodukten holen unsere Datenpartner, die uns Nutzerdaten bereitstellen, entsprechend ihren jeweiligen Datenschutzerklärungen die Einwilligung der Nutzer in die Verarbeitung ihrer personenbezogenen Daten und die Weitergabe an uns ein. Die von unseren Datenpartnern eingeholte Einwilligung entspricht den geltenden gesetzlichen Anforderungen und ermöglicht die Verarbeitungsaktivitäten von Zeotap und seinen Kunden. Jede Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten durch Zeotap unterliegt Ihren unten erläuterten Wahl- und Kontrollrechten. Bei Softwareprodukten treten unsere Kunden als Verantwortliche für die Daten auf und sind dafür zuständig sicherzustellen, dass eine entsprechende Rechtsgrundlage besteht. Beachten Sie, dass wir und unsere Kunden bei Datenprodukten im Fall der Kombination von Kundendaten und Nutzerdaten ",16,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy-de_.txt
zeotap,Datenschutzerklärung für Produkte und Services | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy-de/,"als gemeinsam Verantwortliche auftreten. Als gemeinsam Verantwortliche legen wir und unsere Kunden die Zwecke und Mittel der Verarbeitung der Nutzerdaten gemeinsam fest. In einer Vereinbarung zur gemeinsamen Verantwortlichkeit nach Artikel 26 DSGVO haben wir und unsere Kunden festgelegt, wie die entsprechenden Aufgaben und Verantwortlichkeiten bei der Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten verteilt werden und wer welche Datenschutzpflichten erfüllt. Insbesondere wurde festgelegt, wie ein ausreichendes Schutzniveau und Ihre Rechte als betroffene Person gewährleistet werden können, wie die Informationspflichten nach den geltenden Vorschriften gemeinsam erfüllt werden können und wie sich potenzielle Datenschutzvorfälle überwachen lassen. Dabei geht es auch darum, zu gewährleisten, dass Melde- und Mitteilungspflichten erfüllt werden.

The challenges in the Media industry
Marketers in the Media sector face challenges around acquisition campaign efficiency and preventing potential long-term subscribers from moving to competitors. Large customer bases, which tend to include millions of subscribers, can lead to significant budget wastage if existing customers are not correctly distinguished from prospects and excluded from acquisition campaigns. Furthermore, customers expect media brands to create seamless, contextual, and personalised experiences across every device, which cannot be achieved with legacy systems unable to collect and activate data from every channel. Therefore, having a unified, single view of each customer that includes online and offline IDs with consent choices baked in, is necessary to power accurate predictions of a customer’s likely future behaviour and prevent customer churn. A CDP is then pivotal to helping Media companies meet their business goals.

USE CASE 1
Audience suppression: Exclude media customers from acquisition campaigns
Marketers in the media industry can take advantage of unified customer records to exclude customers from campaigns based on their previous purchases made across all channels. Excluding previous buyers will help to reduce waste, increase conversion rates, impact return on ad spend (ROAS), and avoid a poor customer experience. Plus, customers are not bombarded with irrelevant or duplicate messages. By excluding customers from promotions, marketers’ campaigns are more effective and efficient, increasing the lifetime value of removed customers, maximising the return on investment for each campaign and ensure that customers are receiving the most relevant messages.

This selection is sent to the advertising or marketing platform for delivery to the customer. For example, send promotions of the premium package to subscribers of the basic package based on historical data and prediction models. Marketers can monitor the customer’s behaviour and make new, adjusted selections to provide a more personalised experience to increase customer lifetime value or ARPU and sales.

Easy, secure andimpactful customer data
Our vision At Zeotap, we envision a f",0,https___zeotap_com_about-us_.txt
zeotap,Zeotap CDP | 360 Degree Customer View | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/about-us/,"uture in which businesses can deliver personalised and data-driven customer experiences while putting customer privacy at the front and centre. We are dedicated to helping brands monetise their customer data and achieve commercial outcomes with ease. To achieve this, we have developed and offer must-have software and data solutions to support our customers in achieving their desired business outcomes across marketing, sales, and customer service. We differentiate ourselves by providing addressability in customer data, an easy-to-use platform that drives faster results with data privacy, and compliance heart supported by best-in-class customer support.
History
Zeotap was born in Berlin in 2014 to provide high-quality data to marketers and soon recognised a bigger challenge: brands needed to create multi-channel personalised experiences. But doing so required a means to action customer data in a world that prioritises privacy and compliance. And so, in 2020, we launched our Customer Data",1,https___zeotap_com_about-us_.txt
zeotap,Zeotap CDP | 360 Degree Customer View | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/about-us/," Platform (CDP), a natively integrated SaaS suite built on the Google Cloud Platform.
Today, Zeotap offers two products:
The easy, secure and impactful Customer Data Platform that empowers brands to integrate, unify, segment and orchestrate customer data.
It’s people-based, deterministic data composed of over 500 million unique IDs. Zeotap Data is fully-consented, GDPR and ePrivacy compliant.
Zeotap's history timeline
2014Zeotap was born to build a business, capitalising on all of the data held by telecom companies. This was achieved by selling said data to advertising agencies by integrating them into DSPs.
2016The company continued to grow and expand through client acquisition and investment, continually adding new data partners and expanding into new industries beyond.
2017We achieved higher goals by building a proprietary stitching algorithm, unifying data from different sources, assigning a unique ID to them, and creating a single ‘golden record.’
2019Most companies realised the v",2,https___zeotap_com_about-us_.txt
zeotap,Zeotap CDP | 360 Degree Customer View | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/about-us/,"alue of leveraging their first-party data, and many CDPs emerged. An opportunity arose to use our many years of experience in this market, and expand the Zeotap offering.
2020We built our Customer Data Platform (CDP), a natively integrated SaaS suite built on the Google Cloud Platform
2023We have 70+ clients, 180+ employees, the 5 largest telecom companies, over 50+ recurring clients across Europe, and are associated with top brands like Audi, Johnson & Johnson, Mc Donalds, Sky and Virgin Media. We presently have 120 data sources, all real-time and GDPR-audited data.
Why the name Zeotap?Our name combines two words: “Zeo” and “tap”. “Zeo” comes from “Zeolite,” a mineral that transforms crude oil into everyday essentials, like high-quality fuel which makes crude oil usable and precious which enables societies to develop. It also purifies oxygen from the air by trapping impurities. In our case, our technology transforms customer data to be addressable and actionable the way “Zeolite” tran",3,https___zeotap_com_about-us_.txt
zeotap,Zeotap CDP | 360 Degree Customer View | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/about-us/,"sforms crude oil. Hence, the word “Zeo” symbolises our ability to help businesses get the most impactful results from their data at ease and scale, just like opening a tap and letting it flow.
So, Zeotap means empowering brands to get the best from their data—easily and securely.
Why a triangle?
Our Symbol is a triangle with rounded sides. Each side represents a different founding element of our company:
Customers
Data
Privacy
Our triangle rests on the base side, not the corners; this shows our business’ stability and our customers’ trust.
Our valuesOur values define who we are and how we work daily with customers, prospects, and team members. We let them come through in all that we do!
PioneerDare to be different
We are not afraid to take risks and think outside the box. We are always looking for new and better ways to do things. We want to push boundaries and deliver value through innovation and creativity.
AdaptiveChange is always an opportunity
We remain flexible and responsive to ",4,https___zeotap_com_about-us_.txt
zeotap,Zeotap CDP | 360 Degree Customer View | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/about-us/,"changing circumstances. We are open to new ideas and approaches, as well as listen to understand the perspectives of others. We are willing to learn and grow from new experiences.
Challenger We think, act, and win above our weight class
We take on challenges that others may consider impossible to solve. A strong sense of ownership and a desire to succeed drive us. We put in the hard work and effort necessary to achieve our goals.
TrustworthyActions speak louder than words
We consistently act with integrity and accountability and focus on value creation for our colleagues and customers. We take pride in doing the right thing, even when it may be difficult. We stay true to our word and deliver on commitments.

You can learn more about our Products and Services on our website.Zeotap participates in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework and complies with its Specifications and Policies. Zeotap’s identification number within the framework is 301.Our Data Partners are mobile network operators, mobile application providers, media, technology platform providers, owners of media properties (“Publishers”), brands, agencies and others that have access to certain User Data that they wish to monetize by using our Services.Our clients (“Clients”) are businesses, including brands and agencies (“Advertisers”), Publishers, and other companies that send digital targeted advertising to  consumers.

To accomplish this goal, we adhere to privacy-by-design and privacy-by-default principles throughout the process of designing, building, and delivering our Services.By law, we are required to provide you with information regarding:how and on what legal basis we use and disclose your personal data;how we take care of your privacy rights specific to your personal data;how you can reach us in case you have any concerns regarding this privacy policy (“Policy”) or the way we are handling your personal data.The terms of this Policy apply to all User Data to the extent it contains your personal data as defined in the applicable laws and regulations.This Policy does not apply to personal data collected by our website zeotap.com.

These tools also automatically collect and send us information such as referral URLs, user agent string, and IP addresses. This informati",5,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_withwhom.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy#withwhom,"on is a normal part of the log file information that is routinely exchanged as part of communication between operating systems.When we obtain different User Data pertaining to the same device from multiple Data Partners, we aggregate such User Data and store it against the same Ad ID (advertising identifier, associated with a device) or Cookie ID (a string of characters that websites and servers associate with the browser on which the cookie is stored). Zeotap also maintains a separate ID inventory, which connects the User Data into a common ID (“zeoID”) and is an internal pseudonymous identifier.We enhance User Data to create de-identified data segments and aggregate such segments into segment lists or Ad ID / Cookie ID lists based on our Clients’ preferences. We then share such lists with our Clients to enable them to effectively target the relevant users.We do not process information that directly identifies a particular individual such as an unencrypted name, address or government-",6,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_withwhom.txt

However, whether or not User Data we receive are considered personal or personally identifiable data depends on, among other factors, the definition that applies in a user’s physical location. For example, in some locations, a user’s IP address may be deemed to be personal data, while in others it is not.We do not interact directly with users or their devices, unless a user sends us a deletion request, as described below under “YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA (INCLUDING OPT-OUT OPTIONS)”Please note that as part of our Software Products we may receive various additional categories of User Data from our Clients (including directly identifiable data).Below we describe the User Data categories in more detail.A.

Ad IDs identify a specific device and are implemented both on IDFA and Google Android Advertising ID.We obtain Ad IDs associated with de-ide",7,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_withwhom.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy#withwhom,"ntified User Data from our Data Partners. Ad IDs are then used by our Clients to identify advertising requests and to deliver relevant advertisements. We may also use Ad IDs to establish a relationship between different User Data attributes pertaining to the same user. For example, if we obtain User Data that indicates a certain user is between 25 and 30 years old, and later learn from another Data Partner that the user of the same device is interested in a healthy lifestyle, we combine this information against the same Ad IDs or cookie ID. Cookie IDsAn HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie or simply a cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and is stored in the user’s web browser while the user is browsing.We set third party cookies on behalf of Publishers who provide space for the display of advertising within websites.

We call this activity of linking information “mapping.” We use this information to facilitate the delivery of our Clients’ targeted Ads. B. Browsing data Log file informationIn the course of the mapping activity described in the above paragraph, we receive such information as referral URLs, user agent string, and IP addresses.When you come to the website where Zeotap cookies are set, the log file we automatically receive includes the referral URL, which is the address of the website that you came from. We do not use and discard referral URLs within a reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period.We use IP addresses to derive information such as country and carrier. Afterwards, we discard IP addresses within a reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period.We use user agent string information contained in the log file to determine your device operating system",9,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_withwhom.txt

Afterwards, we discard user agent string within a reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period. C. Offline identifiers Hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbersSome Data Partners or Clients may provide their offline data, such as hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbers. We require that such data are hashed using secure hashing algorithms prior to sharing with Zeotap.We use hashed emails or hashed phone numbers to establish a relationship between offline and online user profiles pertaining to a certain user and enrich the profiles pertaining to those online users. For example, our Client would like to run an advertising campaign on mobile devices targeting users whose hashed email addresses and/or hashed phone numbers the Client already has. However, without respective Ad IDs, the Client cannot target the desired audience. By comparing hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbers provided by the Client with the User Data we have from o",10,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_withwhom.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy#withwhom,"ur Data Partners, we can match hashed email addresses or hashed phone numbers to Ad IDs corresponding to the same user. As a result, we have a list of Ad IDs corresponding to the list of users the Client would like to target. Additionally, we can also enrich those lists with additional profile data, such as the ones described below.Hashed emails would also serve as a basis for the creation of ID+, our tokenized individual pseudonymous identifier and specific to a user. You can learn more about ID+ here. D. Profile data Demographic dataWe may obtain demographic User Data from our Data Partners, such as:user demographics (e.g., age or age range and gender);general geographic area of the user address and zip code;predicted or actual income tier;other demographic information that was received or collected by our Data Partners.Zeotap uses this information to create demographic segments about users, for example, users who are “males, 30 to 34, living in Brooklyn.” We connect segments with Ad",11,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_withwhom.txt

Our Clients may use inferences from this information to send localized ads or targeted ads. We do not process precise location EU and UK data.F. TC StringA TC String’s primary purpose is to encapsulate and encode all the information disclosed to a user and the expression of their preferences for their personal data processing under the GDPR. Using a Consent Management Platform (CMP), the information is captured into an encoded and compact HTTP-transferable string. This string enables communication of transparency and consent information to entities, or “vendors”, that process a user’s personal data. Vendors decode a TC String to determine whether they have the necessary legal bases to process a user’s personal data for their purposes.",13,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_withwhom.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy#withwhom," The concise string data format enables a CMP to persist and retrieve a user’s preferences any time they’re needed as well as transfer that information to any vendors who need it.For further details, please refer to the IAB Europe policies.  Legal basis for processing personal dataOur Services enable our Clients to among other things tailor advertising you see on your internet browser or mobile device to your interests and preferences. As a result, the number of ads that are not relevant or of interest to you will be reduced. To achieve this goal, we need to process your personal data. Such processing operations including the use of cookies or other tracking technologies, are covered by your consent, which especially enables our Clients to use customized audience segments to improve and enhance their marketing activities and marketing reach.Under Data Products, our Data Partners who provide User Data to us collect users’ consent to process their personal data and share it with us accor",14,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_withwhom.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy#withwhom,"ding to their respective privacy policies. The consent collected by our Data Partners complies with the applicable laws requirements and enables Zeotap and its Clients processing activities. Any processing of your personal data by Zeotap is subject to your rights of choice and control as explained below. In accordance with the IAB Europe policies, we may process TC Strings. As TCF Vendor, we have conducted and documented a legitimate interest assessment for the processing of TC String. This assessment has shown that data subjects’ interests and fundamental rights do not override the legitimate interests pursued. Under Software Products, our Clients are acting as data controllers and are responsible for ensuring that an appropriate legal basis is in place.Please note that under Data Products, in case we combine our Client data with User Data, our Clients and us act as joint data controllers. With respect to the joint process, we and our Clients jointly determine the purposes and means o",15,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_withwhom.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy#withwhom,"f processing of User Data. In an agreement on joint controllership pursuant to Article 26 GDPR, we and our Clients have determined how the respective tasks and responsibilities in the processing of personal data are structured and who fulfils which data protection obligations. In particular, it was determined how an appropriate level of security and your rights as a data subject can be ensured, how the information duties under the applicable laws can be fulfilled jointly and how potential data protection incidents can be monitored. This also includes ensuring that reporting and notification obligations are fulfilled.

ID5 identifiers are now an integral part of Zeotap's ID graph
Berlin, Sept 5, 2024 – Zeotap, the leading CDP and Data Solutions Provider, has launched a partnership with ID5, leading identity provider in the digital advertising industry. With Safari, Mozilla and other browsers already operating without third party cookies, and Google’s recent decision to allow users to opt-out of third-party cookie tracking understanding, reaching and monetising audiences at scale is becoming increasingly complicated. To address this challenge, Zeotap and ID5 have integrated the two technologies to offer data activation through cookieless, privacy-compliant ID5 identifiers.
The integration of the ID5 ID into Zeotap’s ID graph facilitates both first party and third party reach. Firstly, Zeotap CDP clients can now seamlessly extend their customer data by leveraging the ID5 ID to activate across the programmatic ecosystem. In addition, Zeotap third party data se",1,https___zeotap_com_news_zeotap-partners-id5-amplify-audience-addressability-overcoming-signalloss_.txt

ID5 employs powerful identity resolution technology that perfectly balances precision with scale, utilising both probabilistic and deterministic methods to reconcile the IDs. As ID5 is widely adopted by publishers and is supported by major DSPs and SSPs, it is a powerful currency in the programmatic ecosystem. This collaboration aims to benefit the whole ecosystem facing the demise of third-party cookies. Marketers can utilise this offering to achieve incremental and alternative reach resulting in better ROI, all while respecting user privacy. The solution also contributes to a better inventory and audience monetisation for publishers, supporting the free internet.
Together, Zeotap and ID5 are committed to providing a Universal ID solution based on transparency and control, ensuring user privacy while enabling personalised experiences in the evolving digital landscape.,

Providing alternative and incremental reach beyond cookies, the proven ID5 methodology will add tremendous value to activation use cases across both CDP and Audience clients. Mathieu and the team wrap everything in service excellence; very much in keeping with the Zeotap ethos. Such a good match of people and technology!”
Mathieu Roche, CEO and Co-Founder of ID5 said: “ID5’s partnership with Zeotap shows our commitment to addressing complex addressability challenges. By integrating the ID5 ID into Zeotap’s ID graph, we will empower marketers and publishers to maintain effective audience targeting and data activation despite signal loss. This collaboration not only enhances ROI for advertisers but also strengthens the open internet by supporting transparent, user-friendly identity solutions that respect privacy to enable personalization at scale.”

These tools also automatically collect and send us information such as referral URLs, user agent string, and IP addresses. This informati",5,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy__jump2.txt

Zeotap also maintains a separate ID inventory, which connects the User Data into a common ID (“zeoID”) and is an internal pseudonymous identifier.We enhance User Data to create de-identified data segments and aggregate such segments into segment lists or Ad ID / Cookie ID lists based on our Clients’ preferences. We then share such lists with our Clients to enable them to effectively target the relevant users.We do not process information that directly identifies a particular individual such as an unencrypted name, address or government-",6,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy__jump2.txt

However, whether or not User Data we receive are considered personal or personally identifiable data depends on, among other factors, the definition that applies in a user’s physical location. For example, in some locations, a user’s IP address may be deemed to be personal data, while in others it is not.We do not interact directly with users or their devices, unless a user sends us a deletion request, as described below under “YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA (INCLUDING OPT-OUT OPTIONS)”Please note that as part of our Software Products we may receive various additional categories of User Data from our Clients (including directly identifiable data).Below we describe the User Data categories in more detail.A. Online identifiers Advertising IDsAd IDs are user-resettable, unique, anonymized identifiers for advertising. Ad IDs identify a specific device and are implemented both on IDFA and Google Android Advertising ID.We obtain Ad IDs associated with de-ide",7,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy__jump2.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy/#jump2,"ntified User Data from our Data Partners. Ad IDs are then used by our Clients to identify advertising requests and to deliver relevant advertisements. We may also use Ad IDs to establish a relationship between different User Data attributes pertaining to the same user. For example, if we obtain User Data that indicates a certain user is between 25 and 30 years old, and later learn from another Data Partner that the user of the same device is interested in a healthy lifestyle, we combine this information against the same Ad IDs or cookie ID. Cookie IDsAn HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie or simply a cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and is stored in the user’s web browser while the user is browsing.We set third party cookies on behalf of Publishers who provide space for the display of advertising within websites. We may use cookies to establish a relationship between devices or data pertaining to the same user. If we already have inf",8,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy__jump2.txt

We call this activity of linking information “mapping.” We use this information to facilitate the delivery of our Clients’ targeted Ads. B. Browsing data Log file informationIn the course of the mapping activity described in the above paragraph, we receive such information as referral URLs, user agent string, and IP addresses.When you come to the website where Zeotap cookies are set, the log file we automatically receive includes the referral URL, which is the address of the website that you came from. We do not use and discard referral URLs within a reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period.We use IP addresses to derive information such as country and carrier.

Afterwards, we discard user agent string within a reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period. C. Offline identifiers Hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbersSome Data Partners or Clients may provide their offline data, such as hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbers. We require that such data are hashed using secure hashing algorithms prior to sharing with Zeotap.We use hashed emails or hashed phone numbers to establish a relationship between offline and online user profiles pertaining to a certain user and enrich the profiles pertaining to those online users. For example, our Client would like to run an advertising campaign on mobile devices targeting users whose hashed email addresses and/or hashed phone numbers the Client already has. However, without respective Ad IDs, the Client cannot target the desired audience. By comparing hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbers provided by the Client with the User Data we have from o",10,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy__jump2.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy/#jump2,"ur Data Partners, we can match hashed email addresses or hashed phone numbers to Ad IDs corresponding to the same user. As a result, we have a list of Ad IDs corresponding to the list of users the Client would like to target. Additionally, we can also enrich those lists with additional profile data, such as the ones described below.Hashed emails would also serve as a basis for the creation of ID+, our tokenized individual pseudonymous identifier and specific to a user. You can learn more about ID+ here. D. Profile data Demographic dataWe may obtain demographic User Data from our Data Partners, such as:user demographics (e.g., age or age range and gender);general geographic area of the user address and zip code;predicted or actual income tier;other demographic information that was received or collected by our Data Partners.Zeotap uses this information to create demographic segments about users, for example, users who are “males, 30 to 34, living in Brooklyn.” We connect segments with Ad",11,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy__jump2.txt

Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar.We transform App Usage and Browsing Data into aggregated segments based on interests or purchase intent (such as Sports Enthusiast, Health & Fitness Buffs) which are of interest to our Clients. Purchase dataWe may obtain purchase data from our Data Partners, such as:items you have bought in stores;items you have bought online;items you have put in a shopping basket online. E.

Our Clients may use inferences from this information to send localized ads or targeted ads. We do not process precise location EU and UK data.F. TC StringA TC String’s primary purpose is to encapsulate and encode all the information disclosed to a user and the expression of their preferences for their personal data processing under the GDPR. Using a Consent Management Platform (CMP), the information is captured into an encoded and compact HTTP-transferable string. This string enables communication of transparency and consent information to entities, or “vendors”, that process a user’s personal data. Vendors decode a TC String to determine whether they have the necessary legal bases to process a user’s personal data for their purposes.",13,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy__jump2.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy/#jump2," The concise string data format enables a CMP to persist and retrieve a user’s preferences any time they’re needed as well as transfer that information to any vendors who need it.For further details, please refer to the IAB Europe policies.  Legal basis for processing personal dataOur Services enable our Clients to among other things tailor advertising you see on your internet browser or mobile device to your interests and preferences. As a result, the number of ads that are not relevant or of interest to you will be reduced. To achieve this goal, we need to process your personal data. Such processing operations including the use of cookies or other tracking technologies, are covered by your consent, which especially enables our Clients to use customized audience segments to improve and enhance their marketing activities and marketing reach.Under Data Products, our Data Partners who provide User Data to us collect users’ consent to process their personal data and share it with us accor",14,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy__jump2.txt

The consent collected by our Data Partners complies with the applicable laws requirements and enables Zeotap and its Clients processing activities. Any processing of your personal data by Zeotap is subject to your rights of choice and control as explained below. In accordance with the IAB Europe policies, we may process TC Strings. As TCF Vendor, we have conducted and documented a legitimate interest assessment for the processing of TC String. This assessment has shown that data subjects’ interests and fundamental rights do not override the legitimate interests pursued. Under Software Products, our Clients are acting as data controllers and are responsible for ensuring that an appropriate legal basis is in place.Please note that under Data Products, in case we combine our Client data with User Data, our Clients and us act as joint data controllers. With respect to the joint process, we and our Clients jointly determine the purposes and means o",15,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy__jump2.txt

In an agreement on joint controllership pursuant to Article 26 GDPR, we and our Clients have determined how the respective tasks and responsibilities in the processing of personal data are structured and who fulfils which data protection obligations. In particular, it was determined how an appropriate level of security and your rights as a data subject can be ensured, how the information duties under the applicable laws can be fulfilled jointly and how potential data protection incidents can be monitored. This also includes ensuring that reporting and notification obligations are fulfilled.

These tools also automatically collect and send us information such as referral URLs, user agent string, and IP addresses. This informati",5,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy,"on is a normal part of the log file information that is routinely exchanged as part of communication between operating systems.When we obtain different User Data pertaining to the same device from multiple Data Partners, we aggregate such User Data and store it against the same Ad ID (advertising identifier, associated with a device) or Cookie ID (a string of characters that websites and servers associate with the browser on which the cookie is stored). Zeotap also maintains a separate ID inventory, which connects the User Data into a common ID (“zeoID”) and is an internal pseudonymous identifier.We enhance User Data to create de-identified data segments and aggregate such segments into segment lists or Ad ID / Cookie ID lists based on our Clients’ preferences. We then share such lists with our Clients to enable them to effectively target the relevant users.We do not process information that directly identifies a particular individual such as an unencrypted name, address or government-",6,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy,"issued ID number. However, whether or not User Data we receive are considered personal or personally identifiable data depends on, among other factors, the definition that applies in a user’s physical location. For example, in some locations, a user’s IP address may be deemed to be personal data, while in others it is not.We do not interact directly with users or their devices, unless a user sends us a deletion request, as described below under “YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA (INCLUDING OPT-OUT OPTIONS)”Please note that as part of our Software Products we may receive various additional categories of User Data from our Clients (including directly identifiable data).Below we describe the User Data categories in more detail.A. Online identifiers Advertising IDsAd IDs are user-resettable, unique, anonymized identifiers for advertising. Ad IDs identify a specific device and are implemented both on IDFA and Google Android Advertising ID.We obtain Ad IDs associated with de-ide",7,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy,"ntified User Data from our Data Partners. Ad IDs are then used by our Clients to identify advertising requests and to deliver relevant advertisements. We may also use Ad IDs to establish a relationship between different User Data attributes pertaining to the same user. For example, if we obtain User Data that indicates a certain user is between 25 and 30 years old, and later learn from another Data Partner that the user of the same device is interested in a healthy lifestyle, we combine this information against the same Ad IDs or cookie ID. Cookie IDsAn HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie or simply a cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and is stored in the user’s web browser while the user is browsing.We set third party cookies on behalf of Publishers who provide space for the display of advertising within websites. We may use cookies to establish a relationship between devices or data pertaining to the same user. If we already have inf",8,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy,"ormation about a device’s user, we may link the information stored in cookies to the device’s Ad ID. We call this activity of linking information “mapping.” We use this information to facilitate the delivery of our Clients’ targeted Ads. B. Browsing data Log file informationIn the course of the mapping activity described in the above paragraph, we receive such information as referral URLs, user agent string, and IP addresses.When you come to the website where Zeotap cookies are set, the log file we automatically receive includes the referral URL, which is the address of the website that you came from. We do not use and discard referral URLs within a reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period.We use IP addresses to derive information such as country and carrier. Afterwards, we discard IP addresses within a reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period.We use user agent string information contained in the log file to determine your device operating system",9,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy," and device model. Afterwards, we discard user agent string within a reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period. C. Offline identifiers Hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbersSome Data Partners or Clients may provide their offline data, such as hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbers. We require that such data are hashed using secure hashing algorithms prior to sharing with Zeotap.We use hashed emails or hashed phone numbers to establish a relationship between offline and online user profiles pertaining to a certain user and enrich the profiles pertaining to those online users. For example, our Client would like to run an advertising campaign on mobile devices targeting users whose hashed email addresses and/or hashed phone numbers the Client already has. However, without respective Ad IDs, the Client cannot target the desired audience. By comparing hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbers provided by the Client with the User Data we have from o",10,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy,"ur Data Partners, we can match hashed email addresses or hashed phone numbers to Ad IDs corresponding to the same user. As a result, we have a list of Ad IDs corresponding to the list of users the Client would like to target. Additionally, we can also enrich those lists with additional profile data, such as the ones described below.Hashed emails would also serve as a basis for the creation of ID+, our tokenized individual pseudonymous identifier and specific to a user. You can learn more about ID+ here. D. Profile data Demographic dataWe may obtain demographic User Data from our Data Partners, such as:user demographics (e.g., age or age range and gender);general geographic area of the user address and zip code;predicted or actual income tier;other demographic information that was received or collected by our Data Partners.Zeotap uses this information to create demographic segments about users, for example, users who are “males, 30 to 34, living in Brooklyn.” We connect segments with Ad",11,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy," IDs so that our Clients can reach their target audiences on mobile devices. App usage dataWe may obtain App Usage and Browsing Data from our Data Partners, such as:apps installed/accessed on a user’s device;app events such as purchases or sign-ins;browsing data such as URLs.URLs are web addresses, a specific character string that constitutes a reference to a resource. Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar.We transform App Usage and Browsing Data into aggregated segments based on interests or purchase intent (such as Sports Enthusiast, Health & Fitness Buffs) which are of interest to our Clients. Purchase dataWe may obtain purchase data from our Data Partners, such as:items you have bought in stores;items you have bought online;items you have put in a shopping basket online. E. Geolocation dataWe may receive data from Data Partners about the physical location of a specific device, including latitude-longitude coordinates obtained through GPS t",12,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy,"ools, Wi-Fi or cell tower triangulation techniques.The location data we receive from Data Partners may be generalized, non-precise location data, or we may render the location data non-precise, in order to provide generalized location data to our Clients. Our Clients may use inferences from this information to send localized ads or targeted ads. We do not process precise location EU and UK data.F. TC StringA TC String’s primary purpose is to encapsulate and encode all the information disclosed to a user and the expression of their preferences for their personal data processing under the GDPR. Using a Consent Management Platform (CMP), the information is captured into an encoded and compact HTTP-transferable string. This string enables communication of transparency and consent information to entities, or “vendors”, that process a user’s personal data. Vendors decode a TC String to determine whether they have the necessary legal bases to process a user’s personal data for their purposes.",13,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy," The concise string data format enables a CMP to persist and retrieve a user’s preferences any time they’re needed as well as transfer that information to any vendors who need it.For further details, please refer to the IAB Europe policies.  Legal basis for processing personal dataOur Services enable our Clients to among other things tailor advertising you see on your internet browser or mobile device to your interests and preferences. As a result, the number of ads that are not relevant or of interest to you will be reduced. To achieve this goal, we need to process your personal data. Such processing operations including the use of cookies or other tracking technologies, are covered by your consent, which especially enables our Clients to use customized audience segments to improve and enhance their marketing activities and marketing reach.Under Data Products, our Data Partners who provide User Data to us collect users’ consent to process their personal data and share it with us accor",14,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy,"ding to their respective privacy policies. The consent collected by our Data Partners complies with the applicable laws requirements and enables Zeotap and its Clients processing activities. Any processing of your personal data by Zeotap is subject to your rights of choice and control as explained below. In accordance with the IAB Europe policies, we may process TC Strings. As TCF Vendor, we have conducted and documented a legitimate interest assessment for the processing of TC String. This assessment has shown that data subjects’ interests and fundamental rights do not override the legitimate interests pursued. Under Software Products, our Clients are acting as data controllers and are responsible for ensuring that an appropriate legal basis is in place.Please note that under Data Products, in case we combine our Client data with User Data, our Clients and us act as joint data controllers. With respect to the joint process, we and our Clients jointly determine the purposes and means o",15,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy,"f processing of User Data. In an agreement on joint controllership pursuant to Article 26 GDPR, we and our Clients have determined how the respective tasks and responsibilities in the processing of personal data are structured and who fulfils which data protection obligations. In particular, it was determined how an appropriate level of security and your rights as a data subject can be ensured, how the information duties under the applicable laws can be fulfilled jointly and how potential data protection incidents can be monitored. This also includes ensuring that reporting and notification obligations are fulfilled.

The challenges in the industry
Sports clubs have always brought together the masses. Today, a sports team can have a global audience of millions of fans connected through many channels – in-stadium, online, app, social, email, live streaming, and on-demand TV. Today’s sports fan is a multi-channel individual who can live anywhere in the world. The immediate challenge for clubs is to understand each fan completely—stitch together the data residing in each channel in order to deliver the best possible omnichannel experience. Secondly, the marketer must be able to remove existing ticket holders from any promotions to optimise budget spend. For example, if a fan viewed a ticket online but bought it from the ticket office at the stadium. Finally, clubs must understand the very best fans to fill the stadium for significant events and promote matchday hospitality packages.

USE CASE 1
Combine data for merger
In order for marketers to drive a true personalised omnichannel experience for fans, browsing and in-stadium purchase data must be combined. By linking online and offline data relating to the same fan, marketers gain a better understanding of their fans’ behaviour and preferences to tailor their marketing strategies accordingly, and better measure the impact of cross-channel promotions. Through a process of matching, standardising and validating data, the attributes of the same fan are linked under a unique ID, enabling a 360-degree view of each fan.
USE CASE 2

Exclude previous buyers
Marketers can take advantage of unified customer records to exclude fans from campaigns based on their previous purchases made across all channels. Excluding previous buyers helps to reduce waste, increase con",3,https___zeotap_com_sports-and-entertainment_.txt

Plus, fans are not bombarded with irrelevant or duplicate messages. By excluding fans from promotions, marketers’ campaigns are more effective and efficient, increasing the lifetime value of removed customers to maximise the return on investment for each campaign and ensures that customers are receiving the most relevant messages.
USE CASE 3
Find high-value customers
Marketers have the challenge of identifying individual fans who have returned high value and are likely to return continued high value in the future. Using Zeotap CDP, Marketers can define criteria for high-value fans to ensure they are targeting the right audience for messages and promotions. High-value fans make multiple purchases in-stadium and online, have a high average order value, or have been loyal fans for a long time. Once the criteria are established, marketers can assemble a list of fans who meet them and create special pr",4,https___zeotap_com_sports-and-entertainment_.txt

Guardrails for peace of mind
Marketers need to execute quickly – and don’t have time for a DPO to determine whether every new campaign has the right consent settings. Zeotap allows you to set universal rules for honouring consent, so you can launch campaigns safely knowing that you’ve got consent and marketing preferences covered.
From consent to preferences
In a world where transparency around data use is critical, you’re likely capturing more than just consent—you’re also storing a user’s preferences on how they want to be communicated to. Zeotap gives you the same orchestration ability with these preferences, helping you easily deliver the right communications.

MetaRouter and Zeotap Partner to Deliver an End-to-End, Europe-Centric Customer Data Solution That Puts Privacy and Security At the Forefront
[Denver CO, August 8, 2024] We are thrilled to announce a new partnership between MetaRouter, the trailblazers in server-side tag management and real-time event routing, and Zeotap CDP, the Customer Data Platform for EMEA’s most innovative brands. This collaboration brings together two industry innovators dedicated to enhancing and centralising customer data management and privacy specifically tailored for the European market. By combining MetaRouter’s robust data routing infrastructure with Zeotap’s advanced CDP capabilities, enterprises can now harness the full potential of their customer data securely and efficiently.Traditional customer data solutions require users to either set up and maintain their own private cloud infrastructure or present consumption-based licensing that is cost-prohibitive at scale.

By collecting customer data in the first-party context and self-hosting it in a single-tenant, private environment, companies can completely control third-party access to sensitive user data. Users can even restrict MetaRouter and Zeotap from sensitive information. This is counter to other event capture solutions designed as multi-tenant SaaS operations whose single-tenant offerings are extensions or separate codebases that lack feature parity and aligned upgrade schedules.
How It Works: Reducing Friction Between Data Collection and Activation
MetaRouter’s data collection capabilities seamlessly integrate with Zeotap’s segmentation and activation features, creating a streamlined path from data collection to actionable insights and personalized customer experiences.Specifically, MetaRou",2,https___zeotap_com_news_metarouter-zeotap-partner-deliver-end-to-end-europe-centric-customer-data-solution-putting-privacy-and-security-first_.txt

This information can then be stitched to other data points for a single customer view.This results in:30-40% more behavioral data collected60% audience increase with more addressable IDs for campaign activation Stronger historical user information with cookies that persist for up to 12 monthsAdditionally, built-in consent management and enforcement practices ensure that all user data is collected with explicit and implicit consent. MetaRouter’s advanced tools for consent enforcement complement Zeotap’s CDP capabilities, providing a robust solution that prioritizes user privacy and regulatory compliance, meaning no data is sent to Zeotap without being compliant.
“Your customer data should live where your customers are. The combined strengths of MetaRouter and Zeotap CDP offer a resilient and future-proof customer data management solution that ensures your consumers’ data is protected,” said Greg Brun",3,https___zeotap_com_news_metarouter-zeotap-partner-deliver-end-to-end-europe-centric-customer-data-solution-putting-privacy-and-security-first_.txt

By centralizing data onto a single platform and deploying it on your private cloud, we offer ownership and true data control back to your organization.”
“This partnership marks a significant advancement in customer data management, offering businesses a powerful combination of advanced data collection, robust ID resolution and seamless activation capabilities,” said Projjol Banerjea, founder and Chief Product Officer of Zeotap. “Together, MetaRouter and Zeotap are committed to empowering businesses to thrive in a privacy-first/cookieless digital ecosystem.”

zeotap,Zeotap CDP Solutions for Automotive Industry,https://zeotap.com/automotive/," data to deliver omnichannel experiences
The challenges in the industry
Data collection is a key challenge for marketers in the Automotive industry due to the car dealerships’ involvement in the buying journey. While car manufacturers own the online experience, dealerships tend to own the showroom experience (offline), fragmenting the data. Creating a repository of first-party customer data from different data silos is critical to sharpening the 360-degree customer view for accurate analysis and optimum campaign performance. Managing engagement over cross-channel touch points is also a challenge. The customer journey might start with a clicked advert on a social platform, taking the prospect to a car manufacturer’s website, but ends offline with a test drive at the showroom. Driving loyalty is also a challenge for marketers as individuals may go many years between buying a new car. Promoting in-app experiences, financial services, car services, and car parts, all help build a strong co",1,https___zeotap_com_automotive_.txt

USE CASE 1
360-degree customer view
Once all relevant online and offline data (e.g. showroom) has been collected (including consent and marketing preferences), Zeotap CDP unifies all disparate first-party data and links IDs and attributes of the same customer to a unique customer profile, providing a 360-degree view of every customer. Zeotap CDP ensures high accuracy of audience segments for optimum omnichannel performance. Zeotap was awarded a patent in recognition of our ability to gather multiple data attributes from various data sources, clean them up, combine them, and use resource allocation to build audience groups for targeted advertising (patent number: US 2021/0365292 A1)

Zeotap CDP can orchestrate the delivery of messages across multiple touchpoints and channels automatically based on a simple drag-and-drop rules engine to provide the best possible customer experience, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Lower Cost of UpsellingSend promotions to customers who abandon shopping carts and stop when it is no longer relevant.
How customer acquisition and growth impact business growth

USE CASE 1
Audience suppression
A unified customer database like Zeotap CDP lets marketers exclude customers from campaigns based on past purchases across all channels. This strategy increases conversion rates, boosts return on ad spend (ROAS), and prevents customers from receiving irrelevant or duplicate messages. Together with 360-degree customer views and automated audience segmentation, marketers can ensure customers receive only the most relevant messages. One Zeotap client saw a 38% higher click-through rate (CTR) and a 20% lower cost per order (CPO) across channels after suppressing audience segments.

USE CASE 2
Cross-sell and upsell campaigns
Marketers can track visitor behaviour and IDs in real-time from downstream activation platforms. They can apply rules to touch points across the customer journey to select the best product based on profile data, which is then sent to the advertising or marketing platform. By monitoring customer behaviour, marketers can adjust selections as needed. Meanwhile, predictive audiences provide even deeper customer insights. With cross-sell and upsell campaigns, marketers can now provide their customers with a more personalised experience to increase customer lifetime value and sales.

zeotap,Zeotap CDP Solutions for Acquisition and Growth Strategies,https://zeotap.com/acquisition-growth/,", social, web, and onsite channels. Customers are removed from the abandoned cart segment once they purchase, ensuring they no longer receive irrelevant offers and ads. This targeted strategy increases the chances of making a sale. One Zeotap client saw a 15% increase in conversion rates with personalised email reminders, and 42% of inactive users returned after receiving personalised offers.

Data-driven retail strategy: an efficient approach to marketing
Unlock the power of informed decision-making with a data-driven approach. This strategy is crucial for anticipating customer needs, tailoring experiences to individual preferences, and streamlining operations for superior results.At the core of this approach is our Customer Data Platform (CDP), which simplifies and enhances your retail strategy:
Collecting Data Seamlessly: Capture customer information from every interaction, whether online or in-store, to ensure no valuable insight is overlooked.Building Unified Customer Profiles: Consolidate this data to break down silos and form comprehensive profiles, providing a complete view of each customer.Segmenting with Ease: Organise your customers into groups based on their preferences, behaviours, and",1,https___zeotap_com_retail-cdp-solution_.txt

Monitoring and Adapting: Continuously monitor how customers interact with your brand in real-time and adapt your strategies to respond to changing demands promptly.
Top 5 CDP use cases for retailers
By leveraging a robust CDP and its comprehensive customer insights, retailers can achieve a myriad of objectives, from recovering abandoned carts to enhancing customer loyalty. Explore below to learn how a CDP can revolutionise your retail operations across various key areas.
Recover Abandoned Carts
Retailers face challenges in understanding customer behaviour and recovering lost sales due to cart abandonment. Personalised follow-up strategies, like email reminders and incentives, help re-engage customers and recover lost sales.Why It Matters: Analysing customer data can uncover pain",2,https___zeotap_com_retail-cdp-solution_.txt

Personalised follow-ups based on behaviour and demographics can drive conversions and recover lost sales. Understanding these insights is crucial for retailers to craft effective strategies, making a CDP invaluable.Zeotap Success Story: A leading retailer faced the challenge of understanding customer behaviour and recovering lost sales due to cart abandonment. Crafted for precision, Zeotap CDP utilised user behaviour data to create comprehensive customer profiles, which were then used to craft personalised journeys effortlessly through the intuitive interface. Using automated triggers, the retailer enabled strategic re-engagement across multiple channels, driving conversions and fostering lasting customer loyalty. The implementation resulted in a remarkable 15% increase in conversion rates with personalised email reminders, and an impressive 42% of inactive users returned after receiving personalised offers.
Increase Average Order Value (AOV)

The outcome was remarkable: a 30% increase in the Cost Order Turnover Ratio and a 46% surge in Average Shopping Cart Value.
Re-engage Inactive Users
Understanding why users become inactive is crucial for retailers. Reconnecting with abandoned cart customers and inactive users is essential to prevent churn and regain lost revenue.Why It Matters: Examining customer data to identify reasons for inactivity can help in deploying targeted campaigns that offer incentives or personalised recommendations, encouraging customers to complete purchases. Leveraging a CDP to identify high-intent actions can trigger messages to push inactive customers toward conversion. Zeotap CDP Success Story: A Retailer wanted to understand why some of the users became inactive. Zeotap CDP, tailored for accuracy, aggregated user behaviour and purchase data, offering a 360-degree customer view. Leveraging",5,https___zeotap_com_retail-cdp-solution_.txt

By analysing inactive user browsing behaviour, Zeotap CDP enables personalised recommendations, resulting in 35% of inactive users returning to make purchases. This approach not only prevents churn but also revitalised lost revenue, showcasing the power of data-driven re-engagement strategies.
Retain Customers and Improve Loyalty
Retailers often prioritise repeat purchases over genuine customer loyalty with outdated programs. However, by tailoring digital content and experiences, along with personalised incentives, they can foster stronger bonds and enhance long-term loyalty.Why It Matters: Retail shoppers seek convenience but may find the shipping process daunting. Loyalty programs, powered by tailored content, elevate the shopping experience and drive repeat purchases. With a CDP, retailers can track and leverage customer data to deliver releva",6,https___zeotap_com_retail-cdp-solution_.txt

zeotap,Zeotap CDP Solutions for Financial Services (FSI) Industry,https://zeotap.com/financial-services/," customer record to personalise experiences
The challenges in the industry
Marketers in the financial services sector are faced with a high customer acquisition cost (CAC) due to the industry’s highly competitive nature, which often includes an incentive for loyal customers to part ways with their existing bank. Sustainable growth puts pressure on improving marketing efficiency and reducing the CAC. Banks and insurers must remain compliant with data privacy regulations, such as GDPR, which protects the rights of millions of customers. Part of this challenge is ensuring that consent is linked to any customer data used for marketing purposes so that consent choices can be honoured to deliver a highly personalised experience that meets expectations. Due to the long-term nature of customer relationships, a complete understanding of omnichannel behaviours is imperative to predict demand to deliver the right automated message at the right time. For example, lifestyle changes such as graduati",1,https___zeotap_com_financial-services_.txt

USE CASE 1
Audience suppresion
Exclude previous buyers
Marketers can take advantage of unified customer records to exclude customers from campaigns based on their previous purchases made across all channels. Excluding previous buyers helps to reduce waste, increase conversion rates, impact return on ad spend (ROAS), and avoid a poor customer experience. Plus, customers are not bombarded with irrelevant or duplicate messages. By excluding customers from promotions, marketers’ campaigns are more effective and efficient, increasing the lifetime value of removed customers to maximise the return on investment for each campaign and ensure that customers are receiving ",3,https___zeotap_com_financial-services_.txt
zeotap,Zeotap CDP Solutions for Financial Services (FSI) Industry,https://zeotap.com/financial-services/,"the most relevant messages.
USE CASE 2
Privacy compliance
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides EU residents with a right to be forgotten and allows fines of up to €20 million or 4% of global revenue—whichever is higher. The stakes are high! Zeotap CDP allows for the storage, configuration and orchestration of consent purposes and marketing preferences data, creating actionable and compliant audience segments ready to reflect the latest consent choices in marketing campaigns. Optimise customer experiences that satisfy data privacy regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA, and quickly and efficiently respond to customer data requests, including the ability to delete customer records from all systems with a click of a button.
USE CASE 3
Trigger messages
Automatically sending messages to customers based on specific actions or events is a critical ingredient in providing a personalised and superior customer experience. Trigger events are moments in time that can be used to id",4,https___zeotap_com_financial-services_.txt

Marketers can use these events to send targeted messages in real-time or even scheduled for the future  to customers most likely interested in the message (for example, an annual event like a Birthday or 30 days before an annual subscription expires). By selecting the best message for each customer, marketers can ensure more effective marketing, improved engagement, and increased customer satisfaction.

Zeotap also maintains a separate ID inventory, which connects the User Data into a common ID (“zeoID”) and is an internal pseudonymous identifier.We enhance User Data to create de-identified data segments and aggregate such segments into segment lists or Ad ID / Cookie ID lists based on our Clients’ preferences. We then share such lists with our Clients to enable them to effectively target the relevant users.We do not process information that directly identifies a particular individual such as an unencrypted name, address or government-",6,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_.txt

However, whether or not User Data we receive are considered personal or personally identifiable data depends on, among other factors, the definition that applies in a user’s physical location. For example, in some locations, a user’s IP address may be deemed to be personal data, while in others it is not.We do not interact directly with users or their devices, unless a user sends us a deletion request, as described below under “YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA (INCLUDING OPT-OUT OPTIONS)”Please note that as part of our Software Products we may receive various additional categories of User Data from our Clients (including directly identifiable data).Below we describe the User Data categories in more detail.A. Online identifiers Advertising IDsAd IDs are user-resettable, unique, anonymized identifiers for advertising. Ad IDs identify a specific device and are implemented both on IDFA and Google Android Advertising ID.We obtain Ad IDs associated with de-ide",7,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy/,"ntified User Data from our Data Partners. Ad IDs are then used by our Clients to identify advertising requests and to deliver relevant advertisements. We may also use Ad IDs to establish a relationship between different User Data attributes pertaining to the same user. For example, if we obtain User Data that indicates a certain user is between 25 and 30 years old, and later learn from another Data Partner that the user of the same device is interested in a healthy lifestyle, we combine this information against the same Ad IDs or cookie ID. Cookie IDsAn HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie or simply a cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and is stored in the user’s web browser while the user is browsing.We set third party cookies on behalf of Publishers who provide space for the display of advertising within websites.

We call this activity of linking information “mapping.” We use this information to facilitate the delivery of our Clients’ targeted Ads. B. Browsing data Log file informationIn the course of the mapping activity described in the above paragraph, we receive such information as referral URLs, user agent string, and IP addresses.When you come to the website where Zeotap cookies are set, the log file we automatically receive includes the referral URL, which is the address of the website that you came from. We do not use and discard referral URLs within a reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period.We use IP addresses to derive information such as country and carrier. Afterwards, we discard IP addresses within a reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period.We use user agent string information contained in the log file to determine your device operating system",9,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_.txt

Afterwards, we discard user agent string within a reasonable time in compliance with our data retention period. C. Offline identifiers Hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbersSome Data Partners or Clients may provide their offline data, such as hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbers. We require that such data are hashed using secure hashing algorithms prior to sharing with Zeotap.We use hashed emails or hashed phone numbers to establish a relationship between offline and online user profiles pertaining to a certain user and enrich the profiles pertaining to those online users. For example, our Client would like to run an advertising campaign on mobile devices targeting users whose hashed email addresses and/or hashed phone numbers the Client already has. However, without respective Ad IDs, the Client cannot target the desired audience. By comparing hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbers provided by the Client with the User Data we have from o",10,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy/,"ur Data Partners, we can match hashed email addresses or hashed phone numbers to Ad IDs corresponding to the same user. As a result, we have a list of Ad IDs corresponding to the list of users the Client would like to target. Additionally, we can also enrich those lists with additional profile data, such as the ones described below.Hashed emails would also serve as a basis for the creation of ID+, our tokenized individual pseudonymous identifier and specific to a user. You can learn more about ID+ here. D. Profile data Demographic dataWe may obtain demographic User Data from our Data Partners, such as:user demographics (e.g., age or age range and gender);general geographic area of the user address and zip code;predicted or actual income tier;other demographic information that was received or collected by our Data Partners.Zeotap uses this information to create demographic segments about users, for example, users who are “males, 30 to 34, living in Brooklyn.” We connect segments with Ad",11,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_.txt

Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar.We transform App Usage and Browsing Data into aggregated segments based on interests or purchase intent (such as Sports Enthusiast, Health & Fitness Buffs) which are of interest to our Clients. Purchase dataWe may obtain purchase data from our Data Partners, such as:items you have bought in stores;items you have bought online;items you have put in a shopping basket online. E.

Our Clients may use inferences from this information to send localized ads or targeted ads. We do not process precise location EU and UK data.F. TC StringA TC String’s primary purpose is to encapsulate and encode all the information disclosed to a user and the expression of their preferences for their personal data processing under the GDPR. Using a Consent Management Platform (CMP), the information is captured into an encoded and compact HTTP-transferable string. This string enables communication of transparency and consent information to entities, or “vendors”, that process a user’s personal data. Vendors decode a TC String to determine whether they have the necessary legal bases to process a user’s personal data for their purposes.",13,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_.txt
zeotap,Product and Service Privacy Policy | Zeotap,https://zeotap.com/product-privacy-policy/," The concise string data format enables a CMP to persist and retrieve a user’s preferences any time they’re needed as well as transfer that information to any vendors who need it.For further details, please refer to the IAB Europe policies.  Legal basis for processing personal dataOur Services enable our Clients to among other things tailor advertising you see on your internet browser or mobile device to your interests and preferences. As a result, the number of ads that are not relevant or of interest to you will be reduced. To achieve this goal, we need to process your personal data. Such processing operations including the use of cookies or other tracking technologies, are covered by your consent, which especially enables our Clients to use customized audience segments to improve and enhance their marketing activities and marketing reach.Under Data Products, our Data Partners who provide User Data to us collect users’ consent to process their personal data and share it with us accor",14,https___zeotap_com_product-privacy-policy_.txt

The consent collected by our Data Partners complies with the applicable laws requirements and enables Zeotap and its Clients processing activities. Any processing of your personal data by Zeotap is subject to your rights of choice and control as explained below. In accordance with the IAB Europe policies, we may process TC Strings. As TCF Vendor, we have conducted and documented a legitimate interest assessment for the processing of TC String. This assessment has shown that data subjects’ interests and fundamental rights do not override the legitimate interests pursued. Under Software Products, our Clients are acting as data controllers and are responsible for ensuring that an appropriate legal basis is in place.Please note that under Data Products, in case we combine our Client data with User Data, our Clients and us act as joint data controllers.

In an agreement on joint controllership pursuant to Article 26 GDPR, we and our Clients have determined how the respective tasks and responsibilities in the processing of personal data are structured and who fulfils which data protection obligations. In particular, it was determined how an appropriate level of security and your rights as a data subject can be ensured, how the information duties under the applicable laws can be fulfilled jointly and how potential data protection incidents can be monitored. This also includes ensuring that reporting and notification obligations are fulfilled.
